Description: # Word2Wiz
        
        Command line tool and web application to convert Word documents to Document
        Wizard configurations.
        
        ### Requirements
        
        For the command line tool:
        
        - python3
        - pip
        - spell
        
        To create a server:
        
        - vagrant
        
        To use the converter from the command line you can install the necessary
        dependencies with pip:
        
        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        To create a server you can run a virtual machine with vagrant (vagrant and
        virtualbox are needed):
        
        ```
        vagrant up
        vagrant provision
        ```
        
        This will download the OS and install dependencies inside that virtual machine.
        
        If you don't want to create a virtual machine, you can also just use the _very
        limited_ flask server, runing
        
        ```
        python3 server.py
        ```
        
        ### How to run it
        
        To run the converter form the 
        
        ### How it works
        
        This tool parses an input docx document, looking for text between the marks `«`
        and `»`. Then, it generates a Spell file, generating questions based on those
        matches. Finally, the spell file is compiled ang an XML is generated with the
        Wizard Configuration.
        
        In the case of the web interface, the output will be a zip file containing the
        wizard configuration XML, the intermediate Spell and a TXT with the link
        between the questions and the metadatas.
        
        ### TODO:
        
        - [ ] Remove the zip files after the session is closed.
        - [ ] Handle colisions in the uploaded files. Two files can have the same name.

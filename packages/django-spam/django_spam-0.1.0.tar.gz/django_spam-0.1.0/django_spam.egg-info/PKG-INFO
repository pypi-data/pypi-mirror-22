        We all hate bots, lets admit it. Especially the ones that try to gain access to our most secret endpoints. Well we have an easy
        solution for your django application. django_spam simply adds common admin urls to url conf so when bots (or human
        for that matter) try and access them, they will get redirected...
        
        For now, add this line to your requirements.txt file:
        
        .. code:: python
        
           pip install django-spam
        
        Add to apps list:
        
        .. code:: python
        
           INSTALLED_APPS = [
               '...',
               'django_spam',
               '...'
           ]
        
        django_spam ships with some default endpoints bots might try to hit. If you would like to add extra routes, simply add
        a ``SPAM_ROUTES`` variable to your settings file that contains a list of extra endpoints you would like
        to add. *no leading slashes*
        
        .. code:: python
        
           SPAM_ROUTES = [
               'admin.php',
               'admin/login.php',
               'administrator/index.php',
               'index.php',
               '...',
           ]
        
        The same goes for ``SPAM_URLS`` you would like traffic to get forwarded to. Add some fun urls:
        
        .. code:: python
        
           SPAM_URLS = [
               # 10 hours of Donald Trump saying bing bing bong
               'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKbOqEk6rsk',
               # 10 hours of Darth Vader breathing
               'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un8FAjXWOBY',
               '...',
           ]
        
        Include ``django_spam.urls`` to root url file:
        
        .. code:: python
        
           '...'
           (r'', include('django_spam.urls')),
           '...',
        
        
        If for some odd reason you need to exclude routes, define ``EXCLUDED_ROUTES`` in settings. *no leading slashes*
        
        .. code:: python
        
           EXCLUDED_ROUTES = [
               'admin.php',
               'index.php'
           ]

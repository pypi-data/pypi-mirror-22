"""
    DDOTS RESTful API Server

    ## Explore the demo server  I suggest you start with signing up a new user. To do so, use `POST /users/` endpoint with `recaptcha_key=\"secret_key\"`.  You will need to know the API Client ID to authenticate, so here it is: `documentation`. Sometimes (e.g. for token refreshing) you might need API Client Secret: `KQ()SWK)SQK)QWSKQW(SKQ)S(QWSQW(SJ*HQ&HQW*SQ*^SSQWSGQSG`.  There are also two built-in users: * `root` (administrator with all permissions) with password `q` * `user` (regular user) with password `w` 

    OpenAPI spec version: 0.1.1

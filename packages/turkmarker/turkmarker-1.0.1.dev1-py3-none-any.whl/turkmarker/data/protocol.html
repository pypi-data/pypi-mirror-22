<h1>MechanicalTurk Facial Landmarking Task</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>During this task you will be marking 66 points on an image of a face using the provided web based interface.  To start
the process you simply need to click on the button for the first point P1, then using the mouse select the corresponding
point on the photograph of the face.</p>
<p><img alt="button image" src="static/example_btn.png"></p>
<p>The smaller example image to the left provides some guidance as to the correct, approximate location of each point.
You should also notice that the example image illustrates the point that is
currently selected for positioning (see example below) and when you select a different point the image and guidance
will change correspondingly.</p>
<p><img alt="example image" src="static/lmrk_P14.jpg"></p>
<p>If you have accidentally placed a point in an invalid position you may see a message similar to that shown in the image
below.  You must correct these warnings before you can submit the task.</p>

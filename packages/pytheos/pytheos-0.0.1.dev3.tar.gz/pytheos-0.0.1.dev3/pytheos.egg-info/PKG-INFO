        Overview
        --------
        
        Pythoeos provides a flexible tool set for calculating pressure from number of
        built-in pressure scales, converting pressure scales, fitting pressure-volume
        and pressure-volume-temperature data to a wide range of equations and their
        combinations.

        Examples and Tutorials
        ----------------------
        
        This package includes number of examples in jupyter notebook, which demonstrate
        a range of operations, calculations, and fittings you can make with pytheos.
        In fact, pytheos is designed to support data analysis using jupyter notebook
        as well as traditional python scripts.

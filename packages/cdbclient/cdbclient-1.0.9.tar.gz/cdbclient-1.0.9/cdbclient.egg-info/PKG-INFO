Description: 
        Rich client bindings for the Rackspace's Cloud Database service REST
        API. This is a fork of the the python-troveclient project from late
        2014, which was written for OpenStack by multiple companies
        including Rackspace and licensed under the Apache License. It includes
        code to take advantage of new functionality created by Rackspace
        since that time.

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
# This kind of 'word policing' is I think a contentious idea, and many people maybe
# find the inclusion of some words here inappropiate. Still, I wanted to have this list
# so that I could do *something* to detect sexist language, as hokey as my current approach is.

sexist_list = set([
'cunt',
'grass-eater', # contentious?
'hussy',
'mansplainer',
'slut',
'tart',
'whore'
])

# TODO: There should be more terms than this.

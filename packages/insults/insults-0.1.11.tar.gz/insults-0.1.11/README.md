### Installation [Development]

If you'd like to contribute and hack on the newspaper project, feel free to clone a development version of this repository locally:

`git clone git://github.com/thundergolfer/Insults.git`

Once you have a copy of the source, run the following scripts:

`./install_miniconda.sh`
`./install_local.sh`

A Conda virtual environment is created and everything needed should be now installed into it. To activate the environment, run:

`source ./run_in_environment.sh`

or alternatively you can run single commands in the environment with:

`./run_in_environment.sh <COMMAND>`

##### Running The Tests

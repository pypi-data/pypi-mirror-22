        Custodia
        ========
        
        A tool for managing secrets.
        
        Custodia is a project that aims to define an API for modern cloud
        applications that allows to easily store and share passwords, tokens,
        certificates and any other secret in a way that keeps data secure,
        manageable and auditable.
        
        The Custodia project offers example implementations of clear text and
        encrypted backends, and aims to soon provide drivers to store data in
        external data stores like the Vault Project, OpenStack's Barbican,
        FreeIPA's Vault and similar.
        
        In future the Custodia project plans to enhance and enrich the API to
        provide access to even more secure means of dealing with private keys,
        like HSM as a Service and other similar security systems.

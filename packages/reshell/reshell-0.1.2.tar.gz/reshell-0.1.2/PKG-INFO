Description: =================================
        reshell - Reverse shell in Python
        =================================
        
        Install
        =========
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install reshell
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        On the host launch receiver with
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ nc -lvp 12345
        
        On destination host launch shell:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ export RESHELL_TARGET=127.0.0.1:12345
            $ reshell
        
        Background
        ==========
        
        Imagine *crazy* environment.
        You can deploy Python package to remote host and have it running.
        And for some reason it doesn't work.
        But you don't have SSH access and can't debug it or see startup logs.
        Also you don't know in advance what will be network address of the remote host.
        
        But you have a dev machine in the same network, where you are free to run anything.
        So you deploy reverse shell through regular deployment process
        and poke around and figure out what's wrong.

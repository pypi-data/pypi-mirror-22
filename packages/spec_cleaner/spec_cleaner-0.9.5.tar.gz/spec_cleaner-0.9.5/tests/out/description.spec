%description -n viewcvs
ViewCVS can browse directories, change logs, and do specific revisions
of files. It can display diffs between versions and show selections of
files based on tags or branches. In addition, ViewCVS has "annotation"
or "blame" support, Bonsai-like query facilities, template-based page
generation, and support for individually configurable virtual hosts. It
also includes support for CvsGraph -- a program to graphically display
the revision trees and branches.

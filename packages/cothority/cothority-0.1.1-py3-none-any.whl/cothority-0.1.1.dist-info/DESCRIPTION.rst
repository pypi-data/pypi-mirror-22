Cothority is a set of conodes that participate in a decentralized,
distributed protocol. Our cothority-code at https://github.com/dedis/cothority
has different services that can be connected to using this library. For
the moment we have the following covered:

* Status - to get the status of a cothority
* Skipchains - to start new skipchains and add blocks to existing skipchains

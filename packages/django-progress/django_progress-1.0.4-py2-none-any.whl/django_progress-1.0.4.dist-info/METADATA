django-progress
===============

A small Django App for monitoring the progress of various operations using a small and handy API.

Example:
```python
from djprogress import with_progress

for item in with_progress(list_of_items, name='My hardcore processing action'):
    # heavy processing action with item

    # You can optionally nest multiple with_progress constructs if you want:
    for subitem in with_progress(list_of_subitems, name='Subprocessing of item'):
        # more heavy processing action with subitem
```

There is a view included where you can get an overview of all running processes and their estimated time of completion.
It makes use of admin media which means that this page works out of the box. Here is an example:

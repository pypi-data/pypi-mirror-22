Description: Mistral Actions for Ansible
        ---------------------------
        
        Note: This project is experimental and in infancy. It might work for you.
        
        However, given interested users and the time I'd like to make it stable and
        useful - so input and help is very welcome!
        
        
        Install
        ~~~~~~~
        
        The actions can be installed via pip, then we need to tell Mistral about them
        and restart Mistral::
        
            pip install mistral-ansible-actions;
            sudo mistral-db-manage populate;
            systemctrl restart openstack-mistral*;
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Calling ansible::
        
            action: ansible
            input:
              hosts: '*'
              module: copy
              module_args: 'src=file.txt dest=/root/file.txt'
              remote_user: stack
              become: true
              become_user: root
        
        Call ansible playbook::
        
            action: ansible-playbook
            input:
              limit_hosts: overcloud-controller-0
              playbook: /home/stack/ansible/my_playbook.yaml
              remote_user: stack
              become: true
              become_user: root
        
        
        Plans/Ideas
        -----------
        
        - We only support a subset of args ansible and ansible-playbook commands,
          more should be exposed. Maybe we can automatically add them all somehow?

best practices.

1.0.0 (2017-05-19)
==================

- Remove Python 2.6 support

- Fix a bug whereby the policy was storing a dict instead of a list in the
  source, which of course broke things subtly when actually using the policy.

- Send empty cookie when forgetting the authentication for the cookie source

0.1.0a3
=======

- Remove Python 3.2 support

- Fix failing tests using pyramid_services >= 0.4 by requiring at least
  pyramid_services 0.3 because it contains the find_service_factory function
  utilized by the test.

0.1.0a2
=======

- Bert was asleep at the keyboard, the fix below is now actually properly fixed
  by decoding to ascii, which is safe because it is base64.

0.1.0a1
=======

- Ticket value is now a string instead of binary, this way Python 3's
  json.dumps() will be able to serialize the value sent to the sources
  remember function.


0.1.0a0
=======

 - Initial release.

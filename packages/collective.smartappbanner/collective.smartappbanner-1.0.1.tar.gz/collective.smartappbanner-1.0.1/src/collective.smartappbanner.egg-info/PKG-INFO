        Features
        --------
        
        - Uses `smart-app-banner.js <https://github.com/kudago/smart-app-banner>`_ from Diva Yv / Kudago.  (Thanks!)
        
        - Adds meta tags, which are handled by the javascript to show a banner for your app when viewed on a mobile device.
        
        - For ios (Apple) the meta tag is actually enough: just fill in the ios App id and ignore all other options.
          The javascript is only used for Android and Windows.

        Translations

        This product has been translated into
        
        - Dutch (Maurits van Rees)
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install collective.smartappbanner by adding it to your buildout::
        
            [buildout]
        
            ...
        
            eggs =
                collective.smartappbanner
        
        
        and then running ``bin/buildout``
        
        After you start your Plone Site, you can install it in the add-ons control panel.
        This adds a control panel where you can configure the app name, app IDs, etcetera.
        
        We only create meta tags if at least one of the app ids is filled in.
        
        
        Debugging
        ---------
        
        You can test how the banner looks, also on for example a laptop, by appending ``?force_platform=ios`` to the URL in your browser.
        Options are ``ios``, ``android``, and ``windows``.

A Collection of Common Tools for cobe.io
========================================

This is a collection of tools common to many cobe.io projects.  It may
or may not contain useful bits otherwise.  The package is reasonably
well documented using docstrings.

Tests are run using ``py.test``, you will need pytest, pytest-cov and
pytest-logbook installed on top of the runtime dependencies to run the
tests.  However you probably prefer to use ``tox`` to run the tests.

rm-protection
=============

A safe alternative for ``rm`` with minimum difference.

What is this?
=============

``rm-protection`` is a safe alternative for removing file. It works
exactly the same as ``rm`` (in fact it passes arguments to rm). The only
difference is that it refuses to procceed if a ``.*.rm-protection`` file is
found and you failed to answer a question.

Quick Start
===========

``pip install rm-protection``

1. Install from PyPi and make an alias for ``rm-p``.
2. Protect your files using ``protect``. If you want to protect everything inside, ``protect -R``.
3. Happy rm-ing!

How does it work?
=================

It consists of two utilities: ``rm-p`` and ``protect``. The latter one
is to help you protect files.

For example, you have a file called ``important_file`` and it is
``protect``\ ed by ``.important_file.rm-protection``. ``rm-p`` will
recognise that ``important_file`` is protected and prompt to ask you a
question stored in ``.important_file.rm-protection``. ``rm-p`` will only
proceed if you get the answer right.

   Basic usage

It will also prevent you from deleting a directory with ``protect``\ ed
file(s) inside.

``rm-protection`` aims at providing maximum protection and flexibility
while making minimum impact on daily operation.

``rm -i`` can be very annoying, ``trash-cli`` is a bit complex (imagine
you have a habit of emptying the trash without a second thought, or
imagine you are trying to free up spaces on a budget vm). Safe-rm is
inconvenient when you really need to delete something (you have to edit
the configuration file).

Instead, ``rm-protection`` asks you a question set by you. You are fully
covered when removing files (you won't accidentally empty the trash with
``trash-cli`` or ``| yes`` with ``rm -i``), and you can quickly remove
files (without editing any configuration files).

How to contribute?
==================

Pull requests and issues are all welcome! Or tell others about this, so
you can even ``protect`` the files you send to others!

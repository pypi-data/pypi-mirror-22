A semantic and regex version filtering/masking library.

Given a filtering mask or regex and a list of versions (as strings), a subset of that list of versions will be returned.
If a mask is given and the mask uses current version references, an explicit current version must also be provided as an
imput must also be provided as an imput.

Inputs
------

Mask/Regex
~~~~~~~~~~

The Mask can be a SemVer v2 valid mask with the following extensions.

Mask Lock Extension
...................

Locks (``L``) are used as a substituion character in the mask where you want to limit the version filter to just those
versions where it has the same value.  If a ``L`` is present anywhere in the mask, a current_version parameter must also
be provided.

Mask Yes Extension
..................

Yes (``Y``) are used to provide wildcard acceptance of any value in the position of the ``Y``.

Boolean AND and OR
..................

Boolean AND operators (``&&``) and boolean OR operators (``||``) can be used to combine masks.  However, both AND and OR
*cannot* be combined in the same expression.

Mask Examples
.............

Some common examples:

* ``'1.Y.0'`` # return only those minor versions that are of major release 1
* ``'L.Y.0'`` # return only those minor versions that are of the currently installed version
* ``'L.L.Y'`` # return only those patch versions that are of the currently installed version
* ``'Y.Y.Y'`` # return all major, minor and patch versions (same as '*')
* ``'L.L.Y || Y.Y.0'`` # return patch versions of my currently installed version or all major and minor releases
* ``'>1.0.0 && <3.0.0'`` # return all versions between 1.0.0 and 3.0.0, exclusive

List of version strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The list of version strings is expected to be a set of well formed semantic versions

Current Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: python

    from version-filter import VersionFilter

    mask = 'L.Y.Y'
    versions = ['1.8.0', '1.8.1', '1.8.2', '1.9.0', '1.9.1', '1.10.0', 'nightly']
    current_version = '1.9.0'

    VersionFilter.semver_filter(mask, versions, current_version)
    # ['1.9.1', '1.10.0']

    VersionFilter.regex_filter(r'^night', versions)
    # ['nightly']

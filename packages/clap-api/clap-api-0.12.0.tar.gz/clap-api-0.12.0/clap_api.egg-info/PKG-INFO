Description: # RedCLAP - Command Line Arguments Parser (Redesigned)
        
        CLAP aims at being powerful and advanced command line interface library for Python 3 language. 
        Having built-in support for modes, optional and obligatory options, 
        options with arguments (with type-checking with arbitrary types) it enables programmers to 
        create rich command line interfaces for Python 3 programs.
        
        
        ----
        
        ## Features of CLAP:
        
        *   support for single-level and nested modes (with per-mode and global options),
        *   support for grouped short options (`ls -lhR`),
        *   support for long options with or without equal-sign-connected arguments (`--log=./file.log` and `--log ./file.log` are both correct),
        *   support for option aliases (short/long names),
        *   support for typed arguments (`str`, `int`, `float` built-in and other arbitrary types via callbacks),
        *   built-in type checking of option arguments,
        *   support for multiple arguments for options (e.g. `--point 0 0`),
        *   checking for missing arguments with options which require them,
        *   checking for conflicting options (eg. `--quiet` must not come with option `--verbose`),
        *   support for options that MUST be passed to the program,
        *   support for options *required by* other options (e.g. `--key` requires `--value`),
        *   support for options *wanted by* other options (e.g. `--which` wants `--this` or `--that` or both),
        *   good set of exceptions with detailed error messages,
        *   ability to load interface from JSON descriptions,
        *   automatic generation of help screens (for `your-tool help` command) with per-mode, per-option, and per-operand descriptions,
            usage examples, and more
        
        CLAP is not the most easy to use command line arguments parser for Python, but I am quite confident that it is one
        of the most powerful (if not *the* most powerful) framework for writing command line interfaces.
        With excellent support for modes, options, and operands, automatic input verification, and help screen generation you
        get a big return on your investment.

Dots Editor
===========
A six-key braille emulator written in python.
-------

Mostly because I was sick of there not being one that is free, easy to use, and easy to install on any operating system.

This is in super-alpha.

Installation
------------

``pip install dots-editor``

Usage
_____

``dots_editor filename.brl``

This will open a file for editing. When you quit (I know, scary), it will save.

[[fe_aliases]]
== aliases

NOTE: This setting is used only when using the <<filtertype_alias,alias>>
    filter.

The value of this setting must be a single alias name, or a list of alias names.
This can be done in any of the ways YAML allows for lists or arrays.  Here are
a few examples.

**Single**
[source,txt]
-------
filters:
- filtertype: alias
  aliases: my_alias
  exclude: False
-------

**List**

- Flow style:
+
[source,txt]
-------
filters:
- filtertype: alias
  aliases: [ my_alias, another_alias ]
  exclude: False
-------

- Block style:
+
[source,txt]
-------
filters:
- filtertype: alias
  aliases:
    - my_alias
    - another_alias
  exclude: False
-------

There is no default value. This setting must be set by the user or an
exception will be raised, and execution will halt.

[[fe_allocation_type]]
== allocation_type

NOTE: This setting is used only when using the
    <<filtertype_allocated,allocated>> filter.

The value of this setting must be one of `require`, `include`, or `exclude`.

Read more about these settings at {ref}/shard-allocation-filtering.html

The default value for this setting is `require`.

[[fe_count]]
== count

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_count,count>> filtertype +
    and is a required setting.

The value for this setting is a number of indices or snapshots to match.

Items will remain in the actionable list depending on the value of
<<fe_exclude,exclude>>, and <<fe_reverse,reverse>>.

There is no default value. This setting must be set by the user or an exception
will be raised, and execution will halt.

[[fe_direction]]
== direction

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_age,age>> filtertype.

This setting must be either `older` or `younger`.  This setting is used to
determine whether indices or snapshots are `older` or `younger` than the
reference point in time determined by <<fe_unit,unit>>,
<<fe_unit_count,unit_count>>, and optionally, <<fe_epoch,epoch>>.  If
`direction` is `older`, then indices (or snapshots) which are _older_ than the
reference point in time will be matched.  Likewise, if `direction` is
`younger`, then indices (or snapshots) which are _younger_ than the reference
point in time will be matched.

There is no default value. This setting must be set by the user or an
exception will be raised, and execution will halt.

[[fe_disk_space]]
== disk_space

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_space,space>> filtertype +
    and is a required setting.

The value for this setting is a number of gigabytes.

Indices in excess of this number of gigabytes will be matched.

There is no default value. This setting must be set by the user or an exception
will be raised, and execution will halt.


[[fe_epoch]]
== epoch

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_age,age>> filtertype.

NOTE: This setting is optional.

The value for this setting must be an epoch timestamp.

<<fe_unit,unit>>, <<fe_unit_count,unit_count>>, and optionally,
<<fe_epoch,epoch>>, are used by Curator to establish the moment in time point of
reference with this formula:

[source,sh]
-----------
point_of_reference = epoch - ((number of seconds in unit) * unit_count)
-----------

If <<fe_epoch,epoch>> is unset, the current time is used. It is possible to set
a point of reference in the future by using a negative value for
<<fe_unit_count,unit_count>>.


[[fe_exclude]]
== exclude

NOTE: This setting is available in _all_ filter types.

If `exclude` is `True`, the filter will remove matches from the actionable list.
If `exclude` is `False`, then only matches will be kept in the actionable list.

The default value for this setting is different for each filter type.


[[fe_field]]
== field

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_age,age>> filtertype.

The value of this setting must be a timestamp field name.  This field must be
present in the indices being filtered or an exception will be raised, and
execution will halt.

This setting is only used when <<fe_source,source>> is `field_stats`.

The default value for this setting is `@timestamp`.

[[fe_key]]
== key

NOTE: This setting is required when using the
    <<filtertype_allocated,allocated filtertype>>.

The value of this setting should correspond to a node setting on one or more
nodes in your cluster.

For example, you might have set

[source,sh]
-----------
node.tag: myvalue
-----------

in your `elasticsearch.yml` file for one or more of your nodes.  To match
allocation in this case, set key to `tag`.

These special attributes are also supported:

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|attribute
|description

|`_name`
|Match nodes by node name

|`_host_ip`
|Match nodes by host IP address (IP associated with hostname)

|`_publish_ip`
|Match nodes by publish IP address

|`_ip`
|Match either `_host_ip` or `_publish_ip`

|`_host`
|Match nodes by hostname
|===

There is no default value. This setting must be set by the user or an exception
will be raised, and execution will halt.

[[fe_kind]]
== kind

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_pattern,pattern>> +
    filtertype and is a required setting.

This setting tells the <<filtertype_pattern,pattern>> what pattern type to
match. Acceptable values for this setting are `prefix`, `suffix`, `timestring`,
and `regex`.

include::inc_filter_chaining.asciidoc[]

There is no default value. This setting must be set by the user or an exception
will be raised, and execution will halt.

[[fe_max_num_segments]]
== max_num_segments

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_forcemerged,forcemerged>>
  filtertype.

The value for this setting is the cutoff number of segments per shard.  Indices
which have this number of segments per shard, or fewer, will be actionable
depending on the value of <<fe_exclude,exclude>>, which is `True` by default for
the <<filtertype_forcemerged,forcemerged>> filter type.

There is no default value. This setting must be set by the user or an exception
will be raised, and execution will halt.

[[fe_reverse]]
== reverse

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_space,space>> filtertype

This setting affects the sort order of the indices.  `True` means
reverse-alphabetical.  This means that if all index names share the same pattern
with a date--e.g. index-2016.03.01--older indices will be selected first.

The default value of this setting is `True`.

This setting is ignored if <<fe_use_age,use_age>> is `True`.


[[fe_source]]
== source
The _source_ from which to derive the index or snapshot age. Can be one of
`name`, `creation_date`, or `field_stats`.

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_age,age>> filtertype, or +
with the <<filtertype_space,space>> filtertype when <<fe_use_age,use_age>> is
set to `True`.

NOTE: When using the <<filtertype_age,age>> filtertype, source requires +
<<fe_direction,direction>>, <<fe_unit,unit>>, <<fe_unit_count,unit_count>>, +
and additionally, the optional setting, <<fe_epoch,epoch>>.

[float]
name
~~~~

Setting source to `name` tells Curator to derive an epoch timestamp from an
index or snapshot name based on a <<fe_timestring,timestring>>.  This was the
only available behavior in previous versions of Curator.

This source requires <<fe_timestring,timestring>> to be set, in addition to
<<fe_direction,direction>>, <<fe_unit,unit>>, and <<fe_unit_count,unit_count>>.

[float]
creation_date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting source to `creation_date` tells Curator to reference the index or
snapshot creation time, as stored in the cluster metadata.

This source requires <<fe_direction,direction>>, <<fe_unit,unit>>, and
<<fe_unit_count,unit_count>>.

[float]
field_stats
~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting source to `field_stats` tells Curator to use a newer Elasticsearch API
call which returns the minimum and maximum value of a field in an index. Curator
will only use timestamp fields, which should be mapped in Elasticsearch as type
`date`.

The <<fe_field,field>> and <<fe_stats_result,stats_result>> settings are
required to use the `field_stats` source.

NOTE: Source `field_stats` only works with indices.

[[fe_state]]
== state

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_state,state>> filtertype.

The value for this setting must be one of `SUCCESS`, `PARTIAL`, `FAILED`,
or `IN_PROGRESS`.  This setting determines what kind of snapshots will be
passed.

The default value for this setting is `SUCCESS`.

[[fe_stats_result]]
== stats_result

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_age,age>> filtertype.

The value for this setting can be either `min_value` or `max_value`.  This
setting is only used when <<fe_source,source>> is `field_stats`, and determines
whether Curator will use the minimum or maximum value of <<fe_field,field>> for
time calculations.

The default value for this setting is `min_value`.



[[fe_timestring]]
== timestring

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_age,age>> filtertype, or +
with the <<filtertype_space,space>> filtertype if <<fe_use_age,use_age>> is
set to `True`.

This setting must be a valid Python strftime string.  It is used to match and
extract the timestamp in an index or snapshot name.

The identifiers that Curator currently recognizes include:

* `Y`: A 4 digit year
* `y`: A 2 digit year
* `m`: The 2 digit month
* `W`: The 2 digit week of the year
* `d`: The 2 digit day of the month
* `H`: The 2 digit hour of the day, in 24 hour notation
* `M`: The 2 digit minute of the hour
* `S`: The 2 digit number of second of the minute
* `j`: The 3 digit day of the year

These identifiers may be combined with each other, and/or separated from each
other with hyphens `-`, periods `.`, underscores `_`, or other characters valid
in an index name.

Each identifier must be preceded by a `%` character in the timestring.  For
example, an index like `index-2016.04.01` would use a timestring of
`'%Y.%m.%d'`.

When <<fe_source,source>> is `name`, this setting must be set by the user or an
exception will be raised, and execution will halt. There is no default value.

[[fe_unit]]
== unit

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_age,age>> filtertype, or +
with the <<filtertype_space,space>> filtertype if <<fe_use_age,use_age>> is
set to `True`.

This setting must be one of `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, `days`, `weeks`,
`months`, or `years`.

<<fe_unit,unit>>, <<fe_unit_count,unit_count>>, and optionally,
<<fe_epoch,epoch>>, are used by Curator to establish the moment in time point of
reference with this formula:

[source,sh]
-----------
point_of_reference = epoch - ((number of seconds in unit) * unit_count)
-----------

The following table helps to illustrate this:

.Time unit reference
[width="50%", cols="<m,<m,", options="header"]
|===
|Unit|Seconds|Note
|seconds|1|One second
|minutes|60|Calculated as 60 seconds
|hours|3600|Calculated as 60 minutes (60 * 60)
|days|86400|Calculated as 24 hours (24 * 3600)
|weeks|604800|Calculated as 7 days (7 * 86400)
|months|2592000|Calculated as 30 days (30 * 86400)
|years|31536000|Calculated as 365 days (365 * 86400)
|===


If <<fe_epoch,epoch>> is unset, the current time is used. It is possible to set
a point of reference in the future by using a negative value for
<<fe_unit_count,unit_count>>.

This setting must be set by the user or an exception will be raised, and
execution will halt.

[[fe_unit_count]]
== unit_count

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_age,age>> filtertype, or +
with the <<filtertype_space,space>> filtertype if <<fe_use_age,use_age>> is
set to `True`.

The value of this setting will be used as a multiplier for <<fe_unit,unit>>.

<<fe_unit,unit>>, <<fe_unit_count,unit_count>>, and optionally,
<<fe_epoch,epoch>>, are used by Curator to establish the moment in time point of
reference with this formula:

[source,sh]
-----------
point_of_reference = epoch - ((number of seconds in unit) * unit_count)
-----------

If <<fe_epoch,epoch>> is unset, the current time is used. It is possible to set
a point of reference in the future by using a negative value for
<<fe_unit_count,unit_count>>.

This setting must be set by the user or an exception will be raised, and
execution will halt.

[[fe_use_age]]
== use_age

This setting allows matching of indices by their age _and_ the space they
consume.  In other words, it sorts all indices in the list by age, then starts
adding the space consumed by each index, beginning from the youngest.  Once the
value of <<fe_disk_space,disk_space>> is reached, all remaining indices, which
are the oldest, will remain in the actionable list, omitting all of the younger
indices.

The default value of this setting is `False`

NOTE: Use of this setting requires the additional setting, <<fe_source,source>>.

[[fe_value]]
== value

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_pattern,pattern>> +
    filtertype and is a required setting.  There is a separate
    <<option_value,value option>> associated with the
    <<allocation,allocation action>>, and the
    <<filtertype_allocated,allocated filtertype>>.

The value of this setting is used by <<fe_kind,kind>> as follows:

* `prefix`: Search the first part of an index name for the provided value
* `suffix`: Search the last part of an index name for the provided value
* `regex`: Provide your own regular expression, and Curator will find the matches.
* `timestring`: An strftime string to extrapolate and find indices that match.
    For example, given a `timestring` of `'%Y.%m.%d'`, matching indices would
    include `logstash-2016.04.01` and `.marvel-2016.04.01`, but not
    `myindex-2016-04-01`, as the pattern is different.

IMPORTANT: Whatever you provide for `value` is always going to be a part of a +
    regular expression.  The safest practice is to always encapsulate within
    single quotes.  For example: `value: '-suffix'`, or `value: 'prefix-'`

There is no default value. This setting must be set by the user or an exception
will be raised, and execution will halt.

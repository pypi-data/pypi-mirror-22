  date: June 3, 2017
  notes: >
    Upgraded monkey-patching strategy to make a copy of the ``textwrap``
    module using ``imp``. We are only patching a copy, so safer, esp.
    with concurrency.
    
    ``shorten`` API added for 3.4 and following.

  version: 0.5.5
  date: June 3, 2017
  notes: >
    Extended ``ansilen()`` to handle cases where it is used
    for length of lists and other non-string objects. This
    is in service of making the function a better and more
    robust version of ``len()`` for monkey-patching.

Description: ===============
        pyramid-asyncio
        ===============
        
        A lib that override pyramid to build asyncio web application.
        
        Basically, it change views to asyncio coroutine.
        
        
        
        .. important ::
        
          This library is a proof of concept and has not been ported to recent version
          of Pyramid and aiohttp.
        
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        pyramid_asyncio add two directives to treat views as coroutine.
        
        * config.add_coroutine_view()
        
        This is a coroutine version of the ``config.add_view``.
        pyramid_asyncio provide also a decorator ``coroutine_view_config`` which
        is the view_config version for coroutine view.
        
        * config.make_asyncio_app()
        
        This create the wsgi app that work with the aiohttp gunicorn worker.
        aiohttp.worker.AsyncGunicornWorker
        
        config.make_wsgi_app() could not be used because the pyramid router
        must be changed.
        
        
        The simple way to create the pyramid app with asyncio is to use the
        scaffold.
        
        pyramid_asyncio comme with a scaffold that create a "hello world" application,
        check it 
        
        ::
        
            pcreate -s aio_jinja2 helloworld

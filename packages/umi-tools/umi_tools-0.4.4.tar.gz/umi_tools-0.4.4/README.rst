Tools for dealing with Unique Molecular Identifiers
====================================================

This repository contains tools for dealing with Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs)/Random Molecular Tags (RMTs). Currently there are three tools:

* extract:
   **Flexible removal of UMI sequences from fastq reads.**
      UMIs are removed and appended to the read name. Any other barcode, for example a library barcode, is left on the read.  

* dedup:
   **Removes PCR duplicates.**
      Implements a number of different UMI deduplication schemes. The recommended method is `directional`.
    
* group: 
   **Groups PCR duplicates using the same methods available through `dedup`.**
      This is useful when you want to interrogate the PCR duplicates

See `QUICK_START.md <QUICK_START.md>`_ for a quick tutorial on the most common usage pattern.

The `dedup` and `group` commands make use of network-based methods to resolve similar UMIs with the same alignment coordinates. For a background regarding these methods see:

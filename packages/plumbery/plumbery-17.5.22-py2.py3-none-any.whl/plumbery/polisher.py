class PlumberyPolisher(object):
    """
    Polishes elements of the fittings plan

    :param settings: specific settings for this polisher
    :type param: ``dict``

    Even embedded fittings deserve some good treatment, and this what
    polishing is about. You know the usual sequence:

    * at some point, decide that all appliances have to be visited
    * find every appliance and prepare it
    * after the hard work, go back home for some rest

    This is exactly what plumbery is offering to you in a straightforward
    extensible mechanism.

        You can create polishers of your own, or use polishers from other
        persons. All polishers have to be placed in the directory
        ``plumbery.polishers``. Each polisher should be put in a separate
        python file, and define a class that repeats the file name. For example
        the file::

            plumbery\\polishers\\configure.py

        should contain::

            class ConfigurePolisher(PlumberyPolisher):
            ...

        Once this is done properly, you can use the polisher by mentioning it
        if the fittings plan used by plumbery. Also, you can pass any
        parameters that the polisher would require.

        Example of configuration of ``fittings.yaml``::

            ---
            safeMode: False
            actions:
              - configure:
                  file: nodes.yaml
              - ansible:
                  file: inventory.yaml
            ---
            # Frankfurt in Europe
            locationId: EU6
            regionId: dd-eu
            ...

        The engine provides multiple ways to polish nodes. For example::

            from plumbery.engine import PlumberyEngine
            PlumberyEngine('fittings.yaml').polish_all_nodes()

    You can create fittings of your own, or use fittings from other
    persons. All fittings have to be placed in the directory
    ``plumbery/fittings``. Each fitting should be put in a separate
    python file, and define a class that repeats the file name. For example
    the file::

        plumbery/fittings/domain.py

    should contain::

        class DomainFitting(PlumberyFitting):

    Once this is done properly, plumbery will be able to parse related
    directives, and to process actions accordingly.

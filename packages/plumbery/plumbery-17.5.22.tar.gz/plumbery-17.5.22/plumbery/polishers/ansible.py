class AnsiblePolisher(InventoryPolisher):
    """
    Captures inventory information for ansible

    This polisher looks at each node in sequence, but only to retrieve
    maximum information about each of them. At the end of the process,
    the polisher writes a YAML file to feed ansible.

    To activate this polisher you have to mention it in the fittings plan,
    like in the following example::

        ---
        safeMode: False
        actions:
          - ansible:
              output: inventory.yaml
        ---
        # Frankfurt in Europe
        locationId: EU6
        regionId: dd-eu
        ...


    """

    def reap(self):
        """
        Saves information gathered through the polishing sequence

        All information captured in dumped in a file, in YAML format,
        to provide a flexible and accurate inventory of live nodes
        that are part of the fittings plan.

        The private ipv4 network addresses are attached to each host, so that
        ansible do not need to rely on DNS settings.

        Plumbery also provides multiple groups of hosts to ansible, based on
        various criteria:

        * data center location
        * hashtags in node description

        As an example, let consider the following fittings plan::

            ---
            locationId: EU6
            regionId: dd-eu
            blueprints:
              - sql:
                  domain: *vdc1
                  ethernet: *data
                  nodes:
                    - slaveSQL:
                        description: 'SQL #vdc1 #secondary'
                        appliance: 'RedHat 6 64-bit 4 CPU'
            ---
            locationId: EU7
            regionId: dd-eu
            blueprints:
              - sql:
                  domain: *vdc2
                  ethernet: *data
                  nodes:
                    - masterSQL:
                        description: 'SQL #vdc2 #primary'
                        appliance: 'RedHat 6 64-bit 4 CPU'


        After the creation of nodes by plumbery, the inventory provided to
        ansible could look like this::

            masterSQL  private_ipv4=10.2.3.8 ansible_ssh_host=10.2.3.8
            slaveSQL  private_ipv4=10.1.3.8 ansible_ssh_ host=10.1.3.8

            [EU6]
            slaveSQL

            [EU7]
            masterSQL

            [plumbery]
            masterSQL
            slaveSQL

            [primary]
            masterSQL

            [secondary]
            slaveSQL

            [vdc1]
            slaveSQL

            [vdc2]
            masterSQL


        Ok, with two nodes it may be quite difficult to find excitment in
        a sophisticated inventory, but you get the idea.

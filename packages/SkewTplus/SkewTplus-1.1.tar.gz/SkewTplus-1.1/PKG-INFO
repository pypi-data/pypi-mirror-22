        SkewTplus -- Atmospheric Profile Plotting and Diagnostics
        =========================================================
        
        SkewTplus provides a few useful tools to help with the plotting and analysis of 
        upper atmosphere data. In particular, it provides some useful classes to 
        handle the awkward skew-x projection.
                
        This package is based on the SkewT Python package developed by Thomas Chubb
        (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SkewT/)
                
        The main difference with the original *SkewT package* is that the vertical soundings 
        plots are handled by a special class (SkewT).
        The new *SkewT* class extends the base
        `matplolib's Figure <http://matplotlib.org/api/figure_api.html?highlight=figure#module-matplotlib.figure>`_
        class with an interface similar to 
        `matplolib's pyplot <http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html>`_.
        It also allows to create Skew-T type plots in a simple way.
        This new class allows a complete control over the Figure properties like
        multiple plots (normal axis and Skew-T axis).
        
        In addition, the **thermodynamics** module was improved.
        All the intensive computations were migrated to Cython and paralellized.
           
        The SkewT Python package was a cornerstone of this project.  
        We are grateful to all its collaborators.

        Documentation
        =============
        
        Check the documentation at http://www.meteo.mcgill.ca/~aperez/SkewTplus/
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        The SkewTplus package need the following dependencies
        
        * matplotlib
        * numpy
        * cython
        * netCDF4
        
        For running the examples:
        
        * Basemap
        
        
        
        Installing SkewT
        ================
        
        PIP install
        -----------
        
        The easiest way is to install the package with pip::
        
            pip install SkewTplus
        
        
        Install from source
        -------------------
        
        The latest version can be installed manually by downloading the sources from
        https://github.com/aperezhortal/SkewTplus
        
        Then, run::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        If you want to put it somewhere different than your system files, you can do::
            
            python setup.py install --prefix=/path/to/local/dir
        
        IMPORTANT: All the dependencies need to be already installed!

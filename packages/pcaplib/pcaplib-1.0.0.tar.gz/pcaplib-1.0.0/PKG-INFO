        ``pcaplib`` is a very simple and lightweight library for reading and writing PCAP files
        
        Reader example::
        
                import pcaplib
                pcap_reader = pcaplib.Reader('capture.pcap')
                for ts in pcap_reader:
                    print(packet)
        
                (1494608771, 459378, 6, 6, b'\\x00\\x0c)\\xaa4\\xc9')
                (1494608771, 459556, 6, 6, b'\\x00\\x0c)\\xaa4\\xc9')
        
        
        
        
        Writer example::
        
                 import pcaplib
        
                 pkt_list = [
                     (1494608771, 459378, 6, 6, b'\\x00\\x0c)\\xaa4\\xc9'),
                     (1494608771, 459556, 6, 6, b'\\x00\\x0c)\\xaa4\\xc9'),
                 ]
        
                 pcap_writer = pcaplib.Writer('capture.pcap', pkt_list)
                 pcap_writer.writer()

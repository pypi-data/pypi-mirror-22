        ==========
        
        **WARNING** This library is currently under development and is not functional.
        
        The hornet library aims to provide a relatively simple interface for working
        with stacking nested configurations from multiple sources.  These sources may be
        JSON files, YAML files, specially formatted environment variables, databases, or
        anything else that you can dream up.

        Installation
        ============
        
        The recommended way to install is using ``pip`` or ``conda``::
        
            pip install hornet
            conda install hornet
        
        Or it can be installed from source using ``setuptools``::
        
            python setup.py install

        License
        =======
        
        I'm using MIT because that's what I'm most familiar with, but really I don't
        care who uses this software or for what reason.  I make no claim to its accuracy
        or reliability, use at your own risk.  This is just a side project for me, so
        don't expect too much.  If you need it under a different license, just shoot me
        an email and I'll work with you on how to make that happen.

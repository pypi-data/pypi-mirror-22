Description: Howler Monkey
        =============
        A slack messaging authentication and interfacing system for the DTG
        -------------------------------------------------------------------
        Intended to allow for automated messaging to our DTG slack group at a controlled endpoint.
        
        Authentication is provided by only allowing connections over local unix domain sockets on a puppy VM. As such any user that can gain access to the host in order to connect must have sufficient monkeysphere auth and thus be a member of the DTG or at least equivalently privileged. Unauthenticated access by minor services can also be mediated by co-locating them on the same host.
        
        Design
        ======
        Server
        ------
        * Python process
        * Loads config from file:
          * Slack Address (includes token)
          * Unix socket address
        * Accepts JSON payloads over unix socket (via standard handler, poss UnixStreamServer)
        * Sends messages to slack via requests (steal code from dtg-lunch-notify)
        * Checks response codes?
        * Sends JSON back over socket detailing if there were any errors?
        * Runs as a daemon (with files for systemd?)
        
        Client
        ------
        * Python Library
        * Provides either a single call interface or object interface
          * Single call of style message(text, channel=None, username=None, icon\_url=None, icon\_emoji=None)
          * Or object which lets you store all the varargs params at init and then just call send(text)
          * Steal more code from dtg-lunch-notify

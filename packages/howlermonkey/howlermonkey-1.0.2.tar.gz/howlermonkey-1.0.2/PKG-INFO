Description: Howler Monkey
        =============
        A slack messaging authentication and interfacing system for the DTG
        -------------------------------------------------------------------
        Intended to allow for automated messaging to our DTG slack group at a controlled endpoint.
        
        Authentication is provided by only allowing connections over local unix domain sockets on a puppy VM. As such any user that can gain access to the host in order to connect must have sufficient monkeysphere auth and thus be a member of the DTG or at least equivalently privileged. Unauthenticated access by minor services can also be mediated by co-locating them on the same host.

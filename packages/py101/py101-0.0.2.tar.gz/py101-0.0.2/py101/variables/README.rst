Variables
----------

Python is a dynamically typed language. This means  variables can have have any type when they are declared. Variables can be, among others, "strings", integral numbers, or real numbers. For example a number can be declared using the following syntax:

.. sourcecode:: python

    my_number = 1
    some_real_number = 3.16


In the case of a string, the value is enclosed in single quotes or double quotes. The difference between the two is that using double quotes makes it easy to include apostrophes (whereas these would terminate the string if using single quotes).

.. sourcecode:: python

  some_string = "This is a string literal"


The equal sign is used to assign the value of a variable, which is known as "Making a variable equal to a value".

Define Variables
----------------

Create a file which:
1. Defines a integer variable named myinteger and assigns the value 4
2. Defines a string variable named mystring and assigns the value "Python String Here"
3. Prints the value of myinteger in the console
4. Prints the value of mystring into the console

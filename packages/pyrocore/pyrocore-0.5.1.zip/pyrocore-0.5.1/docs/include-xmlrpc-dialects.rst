.. warning::

    The syntax of XMLRPC commands changed with rTorrent version 0.8.9,
    and continues to change. Make sure that the versions of rTorrent
    and PyroScope you plan to install or update to are actually compatible.
    There are compensation mechanisms in both projects, but there are limits to those
    â€” scan the respective changelogs for breaking changes.

    *pyrocore* 0.5+ will no longer support the old syntax, and thus not work
    with *rTorrent* 0.8.x versions.
    *rTorrent* 0.9.6 has the old commands disabled by default, and only a
    special command line switch will enable them again, *for now*.
    Also, this documentation uses the new syntax (mostly).

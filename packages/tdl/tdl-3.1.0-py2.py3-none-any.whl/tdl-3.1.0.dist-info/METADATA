==============
 Installation
==============
The recommended way to install is by using pip, make sure pip is up-to-date,
old versions of pip may have issues installing libtcod-cffi.

To install using pip, use the following command::

    python -m pip install tdl

Wheels are missing for PyPy on Mac OS X and Linux, so you'll have to meet the
additional dependencies of libtcod-cffi before running pip.

=======
 About
=======
TDL is a port of the C library libtcod in an attempt to make it more "Pythonic"

The library can be used for displaying tilesets (ANSI, Unicode, or graphical) in true color.

It also provides functionality to compute path-finding and field of view.

python-tdl is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/HexDecimal/python-tdl

Online Documentation: http://pythonhosted.org/tdl/

Issue Tracker: https://github.com/HexDecimal/python-tdl/issues

python-tdl is a cffi port of "libtcod".  You can find more about libtcod at

==============
 Requirements
==============
* Python 2.7+, 3.3+, or PyPy
* Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X
* libtcod-cffi (automatically installed with pip)

Changed
 * `KeyEvent`'s with `text` now have all their modifier keys set to False.
Fixed
 * Undefined behaviour in text events caused crashes on 32-bit builds.

3.0.0 - 2017-03-21
------------------
Added
 * `KeyEvent` supports libtcod text and meta keys.
Changed
 * `KeyEvent` parameters have been moved.
 * This version requires `libtcod-cffi>=2.3.0`.
Deprecated
 * `KeyEvent` camel capped attribute names are deprecated.
Fixed

 * `tdl.map` typedef issues with libtcod-cffi.


2.0.1 - 2017-02-22

 * `tdl.init` renderer was defaulted to OpenGL which is not supported in the
   current version of libtcod.

2.0.0 - 2017-02-15
------------------
Changed
 * Dependencies updated, tdl now requires libtcod-cffi 2.x.x
 * Some event behaviours have changed with SDL2, event keys might be different
   than what you expect.
Removed
 * Key repeat functions were removed from SDL2.
   `set_key_repeat` is now stubbed, and does nothing.

1.6.0 - 2016-11-18
------------------
 * Console.blit methods can now take fg_alpha and bg_alpha parameters.

1.5.3 - 2016-06-04
------------------
 * set_font no longer crashes when loading a file without the implied font size in its name

   Plus it can be used alongside TDL.
 * The libtocd console objects in Console instances have been made public.
 * Added tdl.event.wait function.  This function can called with a timeout and

1.2.0 - 2015-06-06
------------------
 * The set_colors method now changes the default colors used by the draw_*
   methods.  You can use Python's Ellipsis to explicitly select default colors

   function names still exist and are depreciated.
 * The fgcolor and bgcolor parameters have been shortened to fg and bg

1.1.7
 * Noise generator now seeds properly
 * The OS event queue will now be handled during a call to tdl.flush. This

 * Typewriter class removed, use a Window instance for the same functionality
 * setColors method fixed

1.1.4
 * Merged the Typewriter and MetaConsole classes,
   You now have a virtual cursor with Console and Window objects
 * Fixed the clear method on the Window class
 * Fixed screenshot function
 * Fixed some drawing operations with unchanging backgrounds
 * Instances of Console and Noise can be pickled and copied
 * Added KeyEvent.keychar
 * Fixed event.keyWait, and now converts window closed events into Alt+F4

1.1.3

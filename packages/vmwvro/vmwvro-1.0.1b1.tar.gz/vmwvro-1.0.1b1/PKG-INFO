Description: vmwvro
        ======
        
        A simple api library to interface with VMware vRealize Orchestrator (vRO).
        
        Features
        --------
        
        What you can do with ``vmwvro``:
        
        * get workflow information
        * start a workflow
        * monitor a workflow run
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        * Python 3.x
        * `requests v2.14.2 <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/>`_
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ``vmwvro`` is available on the
        `Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/vmwvro/>`_
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            $ pip install vmwvro
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Create a Session object. Session object contains the Url and authentication information for the VMware vRealize Orchestrator appliance.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from vmwvro import Session
        
            vro_url = 'https://some_vro_server:8281'
            vro_usr = 'some_user'
            vro_pwd = 'some_password'
        
            session = Session(url=vro_url, username=vro_usr, password=vro_pwd)
        
        Create a Client object and pass in the session object. Client object exposes methods to interact with VMware vRealize Orchestrator.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from vmwvro import Client
        
            client = Client(session)
        
        Start a workflow - without any parameters.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            wf = client.get_workflow(workflow_id)
        
            wf_run = wf.start()
            print("Workflow state: %s" % wf_run.state)
        
        Start a workflow - with parameters.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from vmwvro.workflows import WorkflowParameters
        
            param = WorkflowParameters()
            param.add(name="vmname", value="some_vm_name", _type="VC:VirtualMachine")
            param.add(name="user", "some_user")
        
            wf_run = wf.start(param)
            print("Workflow state: %s" % wf_run.state)
        
        Wait for a workflow to complete.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            wf_run.wait_until_complete()
            print("Workflow completed with state: %s" % wf_run.state)

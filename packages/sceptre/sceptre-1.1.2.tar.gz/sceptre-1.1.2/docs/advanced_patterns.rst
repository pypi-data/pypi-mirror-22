.. _using_an_environments_connection_manager:

Using an Environment's Connection Manager
-----------------------------------------

When using Sceptre as a Python module, it is possible to make use of an environment's connection manager to make Boto3 calls to that environment's account and region, using the credentials set in environment config.

Once an environment is initialised, the connection manager can be accessed as follows:

.. code-block:: python

  from sceptre.environment import Environment

  env = Environment(
    sceptre_dir="string",
    environment_path="string",
    options={}
  )

  client = env.connection_manager._get_client("<service name>")

Where <service name> can be any of the services `supported by Boto3 <http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/index.html>`_.

This client is a normal Boto3 client, and can be used as such.

.. _user_defined_resolvers:

Custom Resolvers
----------------------

Users can define their own resolvers which are used by Sceptre to resolve the value of a parameter before it is passed to the CloudFormation template.

A resolver is a Python class which inherits from abstract base class ``Resolver`` found in the ``sceptre.resolvers module``.

Resolvers are require to implement a ``resolve()`` function that takes no parameters and to call the base class initializer on initialisation.

Resolvers may have access to ``argument``,  ``stack_config``, ``environment_config`` and ``connection_manager`` as an attribute of ``self``. For example ``self.stack_config``.

This class should be defined in a file which is located at::

  <sceptre_project_dir>/resolvers/<your resolver>.py

An arbitrary file name may be used as it is not checked by Sceptre.

The following python module template can be copied and used:

.. code-block:: python

  from sceptre.resolvers import Resolver

  class CustomResolver(Resolver):

      def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(CustomResolver, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

      def resolve(self):
        """
        resolve is the method called by Sceptre. It should carry out the work
        intended by this resolver. It should return a string to become the
        final value.

        self.argument is available from the base class and contains the
        argument defined in the sceptre config file (see below)

        The following attributes may be available from the base class:
        self.stack_config  (A dict of data from <stack_name>.yaml)
        self.environment_config  (A dict of data from config.yaml)
        self.connection_manager (A connection_manager)
        """
        return self.argument


This resolver can be used in a stack config file with the following syntax::

  template_path: <...>
  parameters:
    param1: !<your_resolver_name> <value> # <your resolver name> is the lower camel-case version
                                          # of your class name, e.g `custom_resolver`
                                          # <value> will be passed to the
                                          #Â resolver's resolve() method.


.. _user_defined_sceptre_hooks:

Custom Hooks
------------------

Users can define their own custom hooks, allowing users to extend hooks and integrate additional functionality into Sceptre projects.

A hook is a Python class which inherits from abstract base class ``Hook`` found in the ``sceptre.hooks module``.

Hooks are require to implement a ``run()`` function that takes no parameters and to call the base class initializer on initialisation.

Hooks may have access to ``argument``,  ``stack_config``, ``environment_config`` and ``connection_manager`` as an attribute of ``self``. For example ``self.stack_config``.

Hook classes are defined in python files located at::

  <sceptre_project_dir>/hooks/<your hook>.py

Sceptre retrieves any class which inherits from base class Hook found within this directory. The name of the hook is the class name in snake case format. e.g. ``class CustomHook`` is ``custom_hook``.  An arbitrary file name may be used as it is not checked by Sceptre.

The following python module template can be copied and used:

.. code-block:: python

  from sceptre.hooks import Hook


  class CustomHook(Hook):

      def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
          super(CustomHook, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

      def run(self):
          """
          run is the method called by Sceptre. It should carry out the work
          intended by this hook.

          self.argument is available from the base class and contains the
          argument defined in the sceptre config file (see below)

          The following attributes may be available from the base class:
          self.stack_config  (A dict of data from <stack_name>.yaml)
          self.environment_config  (A dict of data from config.yaml)
          self.connection_manager (A connection_manager)
          """
          print self.argument


This hook can be used in a stack config file with the following syntax::

  template_path: <...>
  hooks:
    before_create:
      - !custom_hook <argument>  # The argument is accessible via self.argument

<p>This tutorial will help you understand how git works and how to use git to
submit your commit on Github.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">This tutorial is about using Git in bash/cmd, which we highly recommend,
as it&#8217;s cleaner.

<div class="section" id="how-to-install-git">
<h2>How to install Git<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-install-git" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First step is installing Git. Supposing you are on a Debian-based distribution,
this will do:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ sudo apt-get install git-all
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For installing Git on a Mac OS system, you can use the <a class="reference external" href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> package
manager as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ brew install git
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-started-with-coala">
<h2>Getting Started with coala<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started-with-coala" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First of all, you have to fork the repository you are going to contribute to.
This will basically give you a clone of the repository to your own repository.
You can do this by opening <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/coala/coala">this to fork the coala repository</a>
or <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/coala/coala-bears">this to fork the coala-bears repository</a>

<h2>Grabbing coala on your local machine<a class="headerlink" href="#grabbing-coala-on-your-local-machine" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now you should clone the repository to your local machine so that you can have
access to all the code locally and start fixing issues!
To do this, you can use these to clone the coala/coala-bears repositories:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git clone -o upstream https://github.com/coala/coala
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>or</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git clone -o upstream https://github.com/coala/coala-bears

</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>

<p><strong>upstream</strong> is just a name we used for simplicity. You can name it

<p class="last">Don&#8217;t worry if you&#8217;re not familiar with what remotes are. The following

<h2>Getting to work<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-to-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First let&#8217;s talk about remotes. To communicate with the outside world, git uses
what are called remotes. These are repositories other than the one on your
local disk which you can push your changes into (so that other people can see
them) or pull from (so that you can get others changes).
Now you should add a remote of your fork to your local machine so that you can
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pull</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">push</span></code> your commits. This can be simply done by using the
command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git remote add myfork &lt;your_fork_link&gt;

<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git add &lt;file/folder_name&gt;

</div>
<p>Do this until you have added all the files needed for your commit.
Then type:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git commit
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will lead you to a text editor. Now you need to write your commit message.
We are very strict about writing commit messages as they help us maintain
coala <strong>clean</strong> and <strong>stable</strong>. Commit messages usually consists of three main
parts. They should have a newline between them.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>The header</strong></p>
<p>The header should have the name of the file that you have made the change on,
followed by &#8221;:&#8221;, a space, and then a short title that explains the change
made.</p>
<p>Example: <cite>.gitignore: Add a new Constants variable</cite></p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>The body</strong></p>
<p>The body should have a short paragraph that briefly describes the change
that was made, and the reason why this change was needed in imperative.
Its maximum length is 50 characters.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>The issue that is being fixed</strong></p>
<p>This part will usually have &#8220;Fixes &lt;issue_link&gt;&#8221;, so the issue gets
referenced on GitHub.</p>

<p>Now you would like to get your commit into the actual master branch. Making
your changes available to all future users of the project. For this, you will
have to create a Pull Request. To do this, you will have to go on GitHub, on
your fork page. You should change the branch to the one you have worked on and
submitted the commit on. Now you can create a Pull Request by clicking the

<p>This will edit your last commit message. If your commit message was considered

</div>
<div class="section" id="rebasing">
<h2>Rebasing<a class="headerlink" href="#rebasing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As people work on coala new commits will be added. This will result in your
local fork going out of sync with the remote repository.
To sync your changes with the remote repository run the following commands in
the desired branch:</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>This assumes that the remote <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">upstream</span></code> is the original
coala repository at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/coala/coala">https://github.com/coala/coala</a> (or other,
like coala/coala-bears, etc.), <strong>not your fork</strong>.</p>
<p>If you have followed the steps outlined in this guide and cloned
the original coala repository, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">upstream</span></code> should refer to it.
You can proceed to the following section without worry.</p>
<p class="last">If you&#8217;re unsure about this, run <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">remote</span> <span class="pre">-v</span></code> to check which
remote points to the original repository and use that instead
of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">upstream</span></code> in the following section.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git fetch upstream
$ git rebase upstream/master
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will fetch the commits from the remote repository and will merge it into
the branch where you are currently working, and move all of the local commits
that are ahead of the rebased branch to the top of the history on that branch.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>After following these instructions when you try to push to remote you may
get fast-forwarding error. If that is the case, then you will have to
force push since you are attempting to rewrite the git commit history.
To do that append the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--force</span></code> argument in the push command:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$</span> <span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">push</span> <span class="pre">myfork</span> <span class="pre">--force</span></code></p>
<p class="last"><strong>Warning:</strong> Never force-push on the master branch, or any branch not
owned by you.</p>
</div>
<p>To verify whether you have rebased correctly, go to the web page of the
branch in your fork. If it says your branch is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">n</span> <span class="pre">commits</span> <span class="pre">behind</span>
<span class="pre">coala:master</span></code> (or whichever repo you are contributing to), then you
haven&#8217;t correctly rebased yet. Otherwise, you&#8217;re good to go!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="squashing-your-commits">
<h2>Squashing your commits<a class="headerlink" href="#squashing-your-commits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that you have more than one commit and you want them to be
squashed into a single commit. You can take your series of commits and squash
them down into a single commit with the interactive rebasing tool. To squash
your commits run the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git rebase -i master
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">master is the SHA1 hash of the commit before which you want to squash all
the commits and make sure that rebase is done onto master branch.</p>

<p>An editor will be fired up with all the commits in your current branch
(ignoring merge commits), which come after the given commit. Keep the first one
as &#8220;pick&#8221; and on the second and subsequent commits with &#8220;squash&#8221;. After saving,
another editor will be fired up with all the messages of commits which you want
to squash. Clean up all the messages and add a new message to be
displayed for the single commit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="common-git-issues">
<h2>Common Git Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#common-git-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, you use git add-A and add files you didn&#8217;t want to your push (often
after rebasing) and push it to the remote. Here ,is a short outline of, how can
you remove (or revert changes in) particular files from your commit even after
pushing to remote.</p>
<p>In your local repo, to revert the file to the state before the previous commit
run the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git checkout HEAD^ /path/to/file
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now , after reverting the file(s) update your last commit, by running :</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git commit -a --amend
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To apply these changes to the remote you need to force update the branch :</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git push -f myfork
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The procedure outlined above helps roll back changes by one commit only.
&#8216;myfork&#8217; mentioned above is your forked repository, where you push your
commits.</p>
</div>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">checkout</span> <span class="pre">&lt;revision</span> <span class="pre">sha&gt;</span> <span class="pre">path/to/file</span></code> command offers you more
flexibility in reverting the changes in a file, done even from earlier than the
last commit. By replacing the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">HEAD^</span></code> by the revision number of the particular
HEAD commit, you can refer to the required revision of the file.</p>
<p>Might sound a little intimidating, but don&#8217;t worry, an example has been
provided for you.
First you can check the commit&#8217;s revision number, where the file was revised by
running the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git log /path/to/file
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The revision number might look like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">3cdc61015724f9965575ba954c8cd4232c8b42e4</span></code>
Now, to revert the file to that revision, run the command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git checkout 3cdc61015724f9965575ba954c8cd4232c8b42e4 /path/to/file.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now, after the file gets reverted back to the required revision, commit the
changes and (force)push to the remote.</p>

<div class="section" id="useful-git-commands">
<h2>Useful Git commands<a class="headerlink" href="#useful-git-commands" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section will briefly explain some other Git commands you will most likely
use and will really make your work easier.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git config
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">config</span></code> command lets you configure your Git installation (or an
individual repository) from the command line. This command can define
everything from user info to preferences to the behavior of a repository.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git log
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">log</span></code> command displays committed snapshots. It lets you list the
project history, filter it, and search for specific changes. While git status
lets you inspect the working directory and the staging area, git log only
operates on the committed history.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git push --force myfork
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>While we normally use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">push</span> <span class="pre">myfork</span></code> to push your commit to your fork,
after further editing and work on your commit, you will need to use the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--force</span></code> parameter to your push to automatically update your Pull Request.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git reset --hard
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Reset the staging area and the working directory to match the most recent
commit. In addition to unstaging changes, the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--hard</span></code> flag tells Git to
overwrite all changes in the working directory, too. Put another way: this
obliterates all uncommitted changes, so make sure you really want to throw
away your local developments before using it.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git clean
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">clean</span></code> command removes untracked files from your working directory.
This is really more of a convenience command, since it’s trivial to see which
files are untracked with git status and remove them manually. Like an ordinary
rm command, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">clean</span></code> is not undoable, so make sure you really want to
delete the untracked files before you run it.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git checkout &lt;branch&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">checkout</span></code> command is used to switch to another branch in the
repository. Here &lt;branch&gt; is the name of the branch you want to switch to.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git rebase
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Rebasing is the process of moving a branch to a new base commit. From a content
perspective, rebasing really is just moving a branch from one commit to
another. But internally, Git accomplishes this by creating new commits and
applying them to the specified base—it’s literally rewriting your project
history. It’s very important to understand that, even though the branch looks
the same, it’s composed of entirely new commits.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git rebase -i
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Running <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">rebase</span></code> with the -i flag begins an interactive rebasing session.
Instead of blindly moving all of the commits to the new base, interactive
rebasing gives you the opportunity to alter individual commits in the process.
This lets you clean up history by removing, splitting, and altering an existing
series of commits. It’s like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">commit</span> <span class="pre">--amend</span></code> on steroids.
Usage is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$</span> <span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">rebase</span> <span class="pre">-i</span> <span class="pre">&lt;base&gt;</span></code>. Rebase the current branch onto &lt;base&gt;, but
use an interactive rebasing session. This opens an editor where you can enter
commands (described below) for each commit to be rebased. These commands
determine how individual commits will be transferred to the new base. You can
also reorder the commit listing to change the order of the commits themselves.</p>
<p>If you would like more information/commands, please use your favourite search
engine to look for it. Git is widely used throughout the world and there are
many good tutorials and git related Q&amp;A threads out there.</p>

<p><strong>DO NOT WORK ON ANY ISSUE WITHOUT ASSIGNMENT!</strong> If you do, someone else might
work on it as well and we might have no choice but reject one of your Pull
Requests - we hate it if anyone wastes their time. For your own sake, please
follow this guide. We put a lot of work into this for you!</p>
<p>Everyone in the coala community is expected to follow our
<a class="reference external" href="http://coala.io/coc">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>To become part of the coala developers team, there are a few steps you need
to complete. The newcomer process is as follows:</p>
<p>You will start as a newcomer, which is kind of a trial. If you complete the
following tasks, you will become a developer at coala:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>run coala on a project of yours</li>
<li>merge a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">difficulty/newcomer</span></code> Pull Request</li>
<li>review at least a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">difficulty/newcomer</span></code> Pull Request</li>
<li>merge a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">difficulty/low</span></code> Pull Request</li>
<li>review at least a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">difficulty/low</span></code> or higher Pull Request</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>When you ran coala on a project, please fill our
<a class="reference external" href="http://coala.io/usability">usability survey</a>. Once you got your first Pull
Request merged successfully, fill in our
<a class="reference external" href="http://coala.io/newform">survey form</a>. With that you can help us making your
experience better!</p>
<p>Once you have achieved all these, just ask for being promoted on the chat and
provide links to your reviews and merged Pull Requests. Then, you will be able
to name yourself a coala developer!</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last"><strong>Do not only fix a newcomer issue!</strong> Supervising newcomers is really a lot
of work. We&#8217;re all volunteers and we can&#8217;t keep this up if you don&#8217;t help
us in other areas as well!</p>
</div>
<p>Of course, the order is not important, although, we recommend you to start
with a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">newcomer</span></code> issue, end with a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">low</span></code> issue, and review other PRs in
the meantime!</p>
<p>This is a step-based guide that will help you get your first contribution
at coala, making you familiar with the work flow!</p>
<p>For more information about Pull Requests, keep reading!</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p><strong>You do not need to read the coala codebase to get started</strong> - this guide
is intended to help you do that without reading tons of meaningless code.
Nobody is good at that.</p>
<p class="last">Most importantly, this guide is not intended to &#8220;check if you are fit&#8221; to
contribute but rather a crash course to <em>make you fit</em> to contribute. We
are a bit picky when it comes to code quality but it&#8217;s actually not at all
hard to get to this level if you bear with us through this guide.</p>

is about - if you didn&#8217;t do this already. We highly recommend you
<a class="reference external" href="https://coala.io/install">install coala</a> and use it on at least one of your

<h2>Step 1. Meet the Community!<a class="headerlink" href="#step-1-meet-the-community" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To get started, the first step is to meet the community. We use gitter to
communicate, and there the helpful community will guide you.
Join us at <a class="reference external" href="https://coala.io/chat">coala gitter</a>.
The newcomers should ping us &#8220;Hello World&#8221; to let us know they are here
because we care!</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations!</strong> You are now part of our community.</p>

<div class="section" id="step-2-grab-an-invitation-to-the-organization">
<h2>Step 2. Grab an Invitation to the Organization<a class="headerlink" href="#step-2-grab-an-invitation-to-the-organization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let us know on gitter that you are interested in contributing and ask for an
invitation to our org. This is your first step towards contributing.
A maintainer will command <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cobot</span></code> (our gitter bot) to invite
you and be part of the Newcomer team.
The invitation will be sent by mail and you will have to accept
it to join. If you don&#8217;t find the invitation, accept it <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/coala">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you are part of our organization, you can start working on issues.
If you are familiar with git, you can skip the next section and pick an issue.</p>

<h2>Optional. Get Help With Git<a class="headerlink" href="#optional-get-help-with-git" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We use GitHub to manage our repository. If you&#8217;re not familiar with git, we
strongly recommend following a tutorial, such as <a class="reference external" href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">this one</a>.</p>
<p>We also have a page dedicated to git commands that will help you learn the
basics: <a class="reference external" href="http://coala.io/git">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Step 3. Picking Up an Issue<a class="headerlink" href="#step-3-picking-up-an-issue" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now it is time to pick an issue.
It is the best way to familiarise yourself with the codebase.

<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">difficulty/newcomer</span></code> and are only there to give you a glimpse of how it is
to work with us and regarding the workflow.</p>
<p>Now pick an issue which isn&#8217;t assigned, and if you want to fix
it, then leave a comment that you would like to get assigned. This way
we don&#8217;t have multiple people working on the same issue at the same time.
Now you can start working on it.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>As stated before, you should never work on an issue without any
assignment. Fortunately, cobot is here to help you! So, if you are
interested in picking up an issue just write in the gitter chat the
following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">cobot</span> <span class="n">assign</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">issue_link</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

<h2>Step 4. Creating a Fork and Testing Your Changes<a class="headerlink" href="#step-4-creating-a-fork-and-testing-your-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This tutorial implies you working on your fork. To fork the repository, go
to the official repository of coala/coala-bears and click on the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Fork</span></code>
button from the website interface. To add it locally, simply run:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git remote add myfork fork_link
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">myfork</span></code> is the name of your fork, and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fork_link</span></code> is a link to your
fork repository.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>It is important that you do not make your changes on the master branch. To
start working on an issue, you first need to create a new branch where you
will work.</p>
<dl class="last docutils">
<dt>::</dt>
<dd>$ git checkout -b &lt;branchname&gt;</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Now you need to make sure your change is actually working. For this, you will
need to test it locally before pushing it to your fork, and checking it with
concrete examples. The first time, you will need to install some requirements.
This can be done by executing the following command while in the root of the
coala project directory.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ pip3 install -r test-requirements.txt -r requirements.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>After that, you can run coala by simply typing</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ coala
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>into your bash. This will analyze your code and help you fix it.</p>

<p>Now that your commit has been sent to your fork, it is time

<h2>Step 7. Waiting for Review<a class="headerlink" href="#step-7-waiting-for-review" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After creating a Pull Request, your PR is open to the review process (to read
more about it, have patience and it is explained on the next step), and all
you can do is wait. The best thing you can do while at this step is review
other people&#8217;s PRs. Not only will this help the maintainers with the workload,
but this is one of the three core steps towards becoming a full-norm coalaian.
Never close a Pull Request unless you are told to do so.</p>

<div class="admonition note">

them yourself in the future!</p>

something wrong - there will always be someone looking over it before

<div class="section" id="step-8-review-process">
<h2>Step 8. Review Process<a class="headerlink" href="#step-8-review-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After creating your <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Pull</span> <span class="pre">Request</span></code>, it is under the review process. This can
be deduced from the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">process/pending</span> <span class="pre">review</span></code> label. Now all you have to do
is wait, or let the other developers know on Gitter that you have published
your changes.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>your <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Pull</span> <span class="pre">Request</span></code> gets accepted, and your commits will get merged into
the master branch</li>
<li>your <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Pull</span> <span class="pre">Request</span></code> doesn&#8217;t get accepted, and therefore you will

</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Wait until the reviewer has already reviewed your whole Pull Request

* 4.0.0 - May 20 2017

- Fixup short delay after a thread times out

- Fix where in some cases (depending on what was execution when abort was

called), a default handler could print the tracback to stderr outside of the
scope of the normal raise (it would still be raised, just handled twice).

- Add a function decorator which provides a default timeout, allows that
timeout to be overriden by adding a "forceTimeout" kwarg to the function
(configurable), or even running a function to calculate the timeout based on
args for each call

- Some improvements to python2 support

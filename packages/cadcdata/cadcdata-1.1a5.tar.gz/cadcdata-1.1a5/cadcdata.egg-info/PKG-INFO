Description: 
        This package implements a client for access the CADC data Web service (WS)
        
        The package can be used as a library as well as through the cadc-data
        command it installs.
        
        1. Instantiate CadcDataClient and use it to access the data WS.
        
        The only mandatory argument that the CadcDataClient constructor takes is
        a cadcutils.net.Subject that holds the user credentials. The data WS is
        accessed through the get_file, put_file and get_file_info functions of the client.
        
        Example:
           from cadcdata import CadcDataClient
           from cadcutils import net
        
           client = CadcDataClient(net.Subject())
           print(client.get_file_info('GEMINI', '00AUG02_002'))
        
        2. Invoke the cadc-data entry point function. This is the function that
        is used to generate the cadc-data application
        
        Example:
           from cadcdata import main_app
           import sys
        
           sys.argv = ['cadc-data', 'info', '-a', 'GEMINI', '00AUG02_002']
           main_app()
        
        3. Invoke the cadc-data as an external command
        Example:
           import os
           os.system('cadc-data info -a GEMINI 00AUG02_002')
        
        Method 1. is the recommended method as it does not required forking external processes
        and also allows trapping the exceptions and reacting according to the type of the
        error. Method 2 also works but the sys.exit needs to be trapped in order
        to prevent the script from quiting. Method 3, while simple, must rely on inter
        processes communication to determine the result of running the command.

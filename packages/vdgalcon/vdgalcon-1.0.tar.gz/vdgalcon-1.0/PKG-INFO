        Galactic Conquest on VisiData
        
        Take over the galaxy with your warship fleet!  Starting with only one planet
        and 10 ships, you must compete with any number of enemies for the most planets
        and galactic glory.
        
        At the start, most planets are inhabited by savages with only a few spaceships
        for battle.  Some planets have better pilots and their ships get a higher kill percentage than their enemies in battle.
        
        To capture a planet, you need to send a strong enough fleet.  Deploy ships from your planets and conquer the galaxy!
        
        ## Instructions
        
        ### Starting a game
        
        The host has to start a server:
        
            $ ./vdgalcon-server.py
        
        All players then start their clients and login:
        
            $ ./vdgalcon.py http://localhost:8080
        
        (or whatever URL the server prints on startup)
        
        The first time a player name is used, the password is set.
        Players join the game if it has not yet started (each server only hosts one game).
        
        Each player presses `Ctrl-S` when they are ready for the game to start.
        
        Press `M` to go to the Map for this game, or `P` for the list of planets.
        Before the game has started, any player can change `G`ame options or press `N` to generate a New map (`Ctrl-R` to Reload the pages).
        
        When the map is all players are ready, the game begins.
        
        ### Playing the game
        
        From any sheet:
        
        - `M` opens the planet map
        - `P` opens the planet sheet
        - `U` opens the queued deployments sheet (not yet sent to server)
        - `D` opens the full deployments sheet
        - `E` opens the events sheet
        - `Q` allows players to quit
        - `Ctrl-S` submits the pending deployments to the server and signals the player is done
        
        On the `P`lanet sheet:
        - `m` marks the destination planet for a player's ships
        - `f` indicates the source planet
        - The player is then prompted to specify how many ships they wish to deploy from the source planet to the marked planet
        - `gf` sends the provided number of ships from all selected planets to the marked planet
        
        On the `M`ap sheet:
        - The colour of the planet name indicates which player currently 'owns' it
        - White planets are neutral and currently not in anybody's control
        - `SPACE` cycles through `name`, `prod`,`killpct` and `numships` fields
        - You may also mark and deploy on the map sheet, like you would on the `P`lanet sheet
        
        On the `U` queued orders sheet:
        - `e` to modify an order
        - `d` to delete an order
        
        vdgalcon is a VisiData app. [VisiData commands](https://visidata.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/) such as column sorting and cell searching are also available.
        
        When all players have submitted their moves, the turn is over.  Ships arrive, battles are resolved, and planets produce.  Then the next turn begins.

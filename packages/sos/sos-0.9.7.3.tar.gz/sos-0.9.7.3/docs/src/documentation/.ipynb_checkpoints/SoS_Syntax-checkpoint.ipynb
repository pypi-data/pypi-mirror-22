This [short introduction](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html) is good enough for you to get started. A small difference between SoS and regular Python 3 syntax is that SoS is more lenient on the use of mixed tab and spaces for indentation. Although it is highly recommended that you use all spaces for indentation, SoS will give an warning and treat tabs as 4 spaces during execution."

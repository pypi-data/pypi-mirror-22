# HEXLite Python-based solver for a fragment of HEX

This is a solver for a fragment of the HEX language and for Python-based plugins
which is based on Python interfaces of Clingo and WASP and does not contain any
C++ code itself.

The intention is to provide a lightweight system for an easy start with HEX.

The vision is that HEXLite can use existing Python plugins and runs based on
the Clingo or WASP python interface, without realizing the full power of HEX.

The system is currently under development and *only works for certain programs*.

A manuscript about the system is under preparation.

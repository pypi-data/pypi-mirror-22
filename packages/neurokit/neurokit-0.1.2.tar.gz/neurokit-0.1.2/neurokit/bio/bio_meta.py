    Returns
    ----------
    processed_bio : dict
        Dict containing processed bio features.

        Contains the ECG raw signal, the filtered signal, the R peaks indexes, HRV characteristics, all the heartbeats, the Heart Rate, and the RSP filtered signal (if respiration provided), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) features, the EDA raw signal, the filtered signal, the phasic component (if cvxEDA is True), the SCR onsets, peak indexes and amplitudes, the EMG raw signal, the filtered signal and pulse onsets.



    Example
    ----------
    >>> import neurokit as nk
    >>>
    >>> bio_features = nk.bio_process(ecg=ecg_signal, rsp=ecg_signal, eda=eda_signal)

    Notes
    ----------
    *Details*

    - **RSA**: Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is a naturally occurring variation in heart rate that occurs during the breathing cycle, serving as a measure of parasympathetic nervous system activity.

    - **HRV**: Heart-Rate Variability is a finely tuned measure of heart-brain communication, as well as a strong predictor of morbidity and death (Zohar et al., 2013).

       - **SDNN** is the standard deviation of the time interval between successive normal heart beats (*i.e.*, the RR intervals). Reflects all influences on HRV including slow influences across the day, circadian variations, the effect of hormonal influences such as cortisol and epinephrine.
       - The **RMSSD** is the root mean square of the RR intervals (*i.e.*, square root of the mean of the squared differences in time between successive normal heart beats). Reflects high frequency (fast or parasympathetic) influences on HRV (*i.e.*, those influencing larger changes from one beat to the next).
       - **VLF** is the variance (*i.e.*, power) in HRV in the Very Low Frequency (.003 to .04 Hz). Reflect an intrinsic rhythm produced by the heart which is modulated by primarily by sympathetic activity.
       - **LF**  is the variance (*i.e.*, power) in HRV in the Low Frequency (.04 to .15 Hz). Reflects a mixture of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, but in long-term recordings like ours, it reflects sympathetic activity and can be reduced by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propanolol (McCraty & Atkinson, 1996).
       - **HF**  is the variance (*i.e.*, power) in HRV in the High Frequency (.15 to .40 Hz). Reflects fast changes in beat-to-beat variability due to parasympathetic (vagal) activity. Sometimes called the respiratory band because it corresponds to HRV changes related to the respiratory cycle and can be increased by slow, deep breathing (about 6 or 7 breaths per minute) (Kawachi et al., 1995) and decreased by anticholinergic drugs or vagal blockade (Hainsworth, 1995).

    - **Complexity**: Non-linear chaos/complexity measures of RR intervals. See `neurokit.complexity`.

    - **cvxEDA**: Based on a model which describes EDA as the sum of three terms: the phasic component, the tonic component, and an additive white Gaussian noise term incorporating model prediction errors as well as measurement errors and artifacts. This model is physiologically inspired and fully explains EDA through a rigorous methodology based on Bayesian statistics, mathematical convex optimization and sparsity.

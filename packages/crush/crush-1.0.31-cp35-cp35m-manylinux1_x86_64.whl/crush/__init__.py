class Crush(object):
    """Control object placement in a hierarchy.

    The algorithms optimize the placement so that:

    - the devices are filled according to their weight

    - the number of objects that move is proportional to the magnitude
      of the weight of the devices removed or added

    **Choose and chooseleaf retries**

    The "choose firstn" and "choose indep" rule step look for buckets
    of a given type, randomly selecting them. If they are unlucky and
    find the same bucket twice, they will try N+1 times (N being the
    value of the choose_total_tries tunable). If there is a previous
    "set_choose_tries" step in the same rule, it will try O times
    instead (O being the value of the argument of the
    "set_choose_tries" step).

    Note: the choose_total_tries tunable is the number of retry, not
    the number of tries. The number of tries is the number of retry +
    1. The "set_choose_tries" rule step sets the number of tries and
    does not need the + 1. This confusing difference is inherited from
    an off-by-one bug from years ago.

    The "chooseleaf firstn" and "chooseleaf indep" rule step do the same
    as "choose firstn" and "choose indep" but also recursively explore
    each bucket found, looking for a single device. The same device
    may be found in two different buckets because the crush map is not
    a strict hierarchy, it is a DAG. When such a collision happens,
    they will try again. The number of times they try to find a non
    colliding device is:

    - If "firstn" and there is no previous "set_chooseleaf_tries" rule step: try
      N + 1 times (N being the value of the choose_total_tries tunable)

    - If "firstn" and there is a previous "set_chooseleaf_tries" rule
      step: try P times (P being the value of the argument of the
      "set_chooseleaf_tries" rule step)

    - If "indep" and there is no previous "set_chooseleaf_tries" rule step: try
      1 time.

    - If "indep" and there is a previous "set_chooseleaf_tries" rule step:
      try P times (P being the value of the argument of the
      "set_chooseleaf_tries" rule step)

    **Backward compatibility**

    Some tunables and rule steps only exist for backward
    compatibility. Trying to use them will raise an exception, unless
    Crush is created with backward_compatibility=True. They are listed
    here for reference but they are documented in the libcrush api

        Each element can either be a device (i.e. no children and id >= 0),

        The **type** is a user defined string that can be used by
        **rules** to select all buckets of the same type.

        The **name** is a user defined string that uniquely identifies
        the bucket.

        The **id** must either be set for all buckets or not at
        all. If the **id** is provided, it must be a unique negative
        number. If it is not provided, the first available id is
        used.

        The **weight** must either be set for all buckets or not at
        all. If not set, **weight** defaults to the cumulated weight
        of the immediate children bucket or devices or reference,
        recursively, bottom to top.

        Children within a bucket are chosen with one of three
        **algorithms** representing a tradeoff between performance
        and reorganization efficiency. If you are unsure, we recommend
        using **"straw2"**. The table summarizes how the speed of each
        option measures up against mapping stability when items are
        added or removed::

            Bucket Alg     Speed       Additions    Removals
            ------------------------------------------------
            "straw2"        O(n)       optimal      optimal
            "uniform"       O(1)       poor         poor
            "list"          O(n)       optimal      poor

        - **"straw2"**: List and tree buckets are structured such that
          a limited number of hash values need to be calculated and
          compared to weights in order to select a bucket child. In
          doing so, they divide and conquer in a way that either gives
          certain children precedence (e. g., those at the beginning
          of a list) or obviates the need to consider entire subtrees
          of children at all. That improves the performance of the
          replica placement process, but can also introduce suboptimal
          reorganization behavior when the contents of a bucket change
          due an addition, removal, or re-weighting of an child. The
          straw2 bucket type allows all children to fairly `compete`
          against each other for replica placement through a process
          analogous to a draw of straws. To place a replica, a straw
          of random length is drawn for each child in the bucket.  The
          child with the longest straw wins.  The length of each straw
          is initially a value in a fixed range.  Each straw length is
          scaled by a factor based on the childâ€™s weight so that
          heavily weighted children are more likely to win the draw.
          Although this process is almost twice as slow (on average)
          than a list bucket and even slower than a tree bucket (which
          scales logarithmically), straw2 buckets result in optimal
          data movement between nested children when modified.

        - **"uniform"**: Devices are rarely added individually in a
          large system.  Instead, new storage is typically deployed in
          blocks of identical devices, often as an additional shelf in
          a server rack or perhaps an entire cabinet. Devices reaching
          their end of life are often similarly decommissioned as a
          set (individual failures aside), making it natural to treat
          them as a unit. Uniform buckets are used to represent an
          identical set of devices in such circumstances. The key
          advantage in doing so is performance related: Crush can map
          replicas into uniform buckets in constant time. In cases
          where the uniformity restrictions are not appropriate, other
          bucket types can be used. If the size of a uniform bucket
          changes, there is a complete reshuffling of data between
          devices, much like conventional hash-based distribution
          strategies.

        - **"list"**: List buckets structure their contents as a
          linked list, and can contain children with arbitrary
          weights.  To place a replica, Crush begins at the head of
          the list with the most recently added child and compares its
          weight to the sum of all remaining childrenâ€™ weights.
          Depending on the value of the hash function, either the
          current child is chosen with the appropriate probability, or
          the process continues recursively down the list. This is a
          natural and intuitive choice for an expanding cluster:
          either an object is relocated to the newest device with some
          appropriate probability, or it remains on the older devices
          as before.  The result is optimal data migration when
          children are added to the bucket. Children removed from the
          middle or tail of the list, however, can result in a
          significant amount of unnecessary movement, making list
          buckets most suitable for circumstances in which they never
          (or very rarely) shrink.

        There also exists an older version of "straw2", known as **"straw"**.
        Given the choice, it is *always* better to use "straw2"; "straw" is
        therefore not allowed by default. If the crushmap being read is old
        and still uses "straw", setting `backward_compatibility=True` when
        creating the `Crush` object will allow it to be used.

        The **id** must be a unique positive number.

        The **name** is a user defined string that uniquely identifies
        the device.

        If the **weight** of a device A is lower than the
        **weight** of a device B, it will be less likely to be used.
        A common pattern is to set the **weight** to 0x20000 for 2TB
        devices, 0x10000 for 1TB devices, 0x08000 for 500GB devices, etc.

        When calling **map()** with this **choose_args_bucket**,
        straw2 will use **choose_args_ids** instead of the items it

        bucket, it will use one of **choose_args_weight_set**,
        depending on the position. See **map()** for more information.

        The bucket is uniquely identified by either **bucket_id**
        which must be a negative number or **bucket_name** which is
        the name of the bucket set in the **bucket** definition. The
        two are mutually exclusive.
        ::

            choose_args_ids = [ <int>, <int>, ... ]

        The first element of **choose_args_ids** will be used instead
        of the id of the first children and so on.

        The size of **choose_args_ids** must be exactly the same as

        When **map()** chooses the frist replicas from the

        instead of the weights stored in the **bucket**. When choosing
        the second replica it will use the weights at positon 1 and so
        on.

        The size of the array for each position must be exactly the
        same as the size of the **children** array of the corresponding
        **bucket**.

        If **choose_args_weight_set** does not contain a list of weights
        for a given position, the weights in the last available position
        will be used instead.

        """Map an object to a list of devices.

        The **rule** is used to map the **value** (representing an
        object) to the desired number of devices
        (**replication_count**) and return them in a list. The
        probabilities for a given device to be selected can be
        modified by the **weights** dictionnary or by **choose_args**
        for straw2 buckets.

        If the mapping is successful, a list of device containing
        exactly **replication_count** devices is returned. If the
        mapping fails, the list may contains less devices or some
        names may be replaced by None. For instance, if asking
        for 3 replicas, the result of a failed mapping could be::

            [ "device1", "device5" ] # 2 instead of 3
            [ "device8", None, "device0" ] # second device is missing

        The dictionary of **weights** modifies the probabilities for
        the device names it contains. The value is a float in the
        range [0..1]. If the weight is 0, the device will never be
        selected.  If the weight is 1, the probability that the device
        is selected is not modified. If a device is not in the
        **weights** dictionary, its probability is not modified. For
        example::

            { "device0": 0.50, "device1": 0.75 }

        will multiply the probability of "device0" by 0.50 (i.e,
        reduce it by 50%) and "device1" by 0.75 (i.e, reduce it by
        25%).

        If the **choose_args** is a string, the corresponding list
        will be retrieved from **choose_arg_map** in the map. Each
        element in the **choose_args** list modifies the parameters of
        the choose function for the corresponding straw2 bucket. With
        a bucket containing two children::

            {
               "name": "bucket1":
               "children": [
                   { "name": "device1", "id": 1, "weight": 1 * 0x10000 },
                   { "name": "device2", "id": 2, "weight": 2 * 0x10000 },
               ]
            }

        If map(85) == [ 'device2' ], the result could be different
        by switching the weights with::

            map(85, choose_args=[
              { "bucket_name": "bucket1",
                "weight_set": [ [ 2 * 0x10000, 1 * 0x10000 ] ]
              }]) == [ 'device1' ]

        Similarly the result can be influenced by providing
        alternative ids. The id of each item is a parameter of the
        hash considered for placement. However, contrary to the
        weight, there is no way to guess how it will influence the
        result.::

            map(85, choose_args=[
              { "bucket_name": "bucket1",
                "ids": [ 100, 300 ]
              }]) == [ 'device1' ]

        - **value**: the number to map (required integer)

        - **replication_count**: the desired number of devices

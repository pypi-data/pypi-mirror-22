`osquery <https://github.com/facebook/osquery>`_ exposes an operating system as
a high-performance relational database. This allows you to write SQL-based
queries to explore operating system data. With osquery, SQL tables represent
abstract concepts such as running processes, loaded kernel modules, open
network connections, browser plugins, hardware events or file hashes.

What is osquery-python?
-----------------------

In osquery, SQL tables, configuration retrieval, log handling, etc are implemented
via a simple, robust plugin and extensions API. This project contains the official
Python bindings for creating osquery extensions in Python. Consider the following
example:

.. code-block:: python

  #!/usr/bin/env python

  import osquery

  @osquery.register_plugin
  class MyTablePlugin(osquery.TablePlugin):
      def name(self):
          return "foobar"

      def columns(self):
          return [
              osquery.TableColumn(name="foo", type=osquery.STRING),
              osquery.TableColumn(name="baz", type=osquery.STRING),
          ]

      def generate(self, context):
          query_data = []

          for _ in range(2):
              row = {}
              row["foo"] = "bar"
              row["baz"] = "baz"
              query_data.append(row)

          return query_data

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      osquery.start_extension(name="my_awesome_extension",
                              version="1.0.0",)

To test this code start an osquery shell:

.. code-block:: none

  osqueryi --nodisable_extensions
  osquery> select value from osquery_flags where name = 'extensions_socket';
  +-----------------------------------+
  | value                             |
  +-----------------------------------+
  | /Users/USERNAME/.osquery/shell.em |
  +-----------------------------------+

Then start the Python extension:

.. code-block:: none

  python ./my_table_plugin.py --socket /Users/USERNAME/.osquery/shell.em

Alternatively, you can also autoload your extension when starting an osquery shell:

.. code-block:: none

  osqueryi --extension path_to_my_table_plugin.py

This will register a table called "foobar". As you can see, the table will
return two rows:

.. code-block:: none

  osquery> select * from foobar;
  +-----+-----+
  | foo | baz |
  +-----+-----+
  | bar | baz |
  | bar | baz |
  +-----+-----+
  osquery>


This is obviously a contrived example, but it's easy to imagine the
possibilities.

Using the instructions found on the `wiki
<https://osquery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development/osquery-sdk/>`_,
you can easily deploy your extension with an existing osquery deployment.

Extensions are the core way that you can extend and customize osquery. At
Facebook, we use extensions extensively to implement many plugins that take
advantage of internal APIs and tools.

Execute queries in Python
-------------------------

The same Thrift bindings can be used to create a Python client for the osqueryd or
osqueryi's extension socket. There are helper classes provided that spawn an ephemeral
osquery process for consecutive or long running client instances.

.. code-block:: python

  import osquery

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      # Spawn an osquery process using an ephemeral extension socket.
      instance = osquery.SpawnInstance()
      instance.open()
  
      # Issues queries and call osquery Thrift APIs.
      instance.client.query("select timestamp from time")

Install
-------

This module is currently in "beta mode". We're testing the API and UX before
uploading the module to PyPI.

To install, clone this repo and run the following:

.. code-block:: none

  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install

Alternatively, if you don't want to clone the repo, you can simply:

.. code-block:: none

  pip install git+git://github.com/osquery/osquery-python.git

Development
-----------
See `CONTRIBUTING.md <https://github.com/osquery/osquery-python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_
and the `osquery wiki <https://osquery.readthedocs.org>`_ for development information.

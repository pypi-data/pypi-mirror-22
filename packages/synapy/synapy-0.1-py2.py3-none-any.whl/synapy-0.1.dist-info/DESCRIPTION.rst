Synapy is a Python implementation of a synaptic matrix. This project represents an ongoing search for new neurobiologically inspired learning algorithms and computational techniques. This work is inspired by, and based on, Dr. Arnold Trehub's work. Particularly, this project is based on his concept of the synaptic matrix.

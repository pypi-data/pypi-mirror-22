	:alt: Requirements Status

My robot software.

* Doesn't use `ROS <http://ros.org>`_, ROS is a pain to install and maintain on macOS and various linux systems
	* Uses some of the same ideas, but not RPC-XML
* Uses `Zero MQ <http://http://zeromq.org/>`_ instead of ``roscore``
* Uses OpenCV to process on-board or stream video off-board to remote
* All of this runs on `Raspberry Pi3 <http://www.raspberrypi.org>`_

Documentation
-------------------

**Note:** This re-write is still very early and not fully running yet, just
parts.

The documentation can be found `here <docs/Markdown>`_.

Install
-----------

Use ``brew`` or ``apt-get`` to install these dependencies:

* zeromq
* opencv 3.x

pip
~~~~~

The recommended way to install this library is::

	pip install pygecko

Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to develop and submit git-pulls, you can do::

	git clone https://github.com/walchko/pygecko
	cd pygecko
	pip install -e .

Testing
~~~~~~~~~

Since I have both python2 and python3 installed, I need to test with both::

	python2 -m nose *.py
	python3 -m nose *.py

**Warning:** python3 is not fully supported yet, it is giving me problems. Only
python2 is currently supported.

Layout
------------

pyGecko **still in development**

* example/servers: main message server nodes

	* Speech server
	* Navigation server
	* Vision processing server
	* VideoOdometry server

* bin: command line programs

	* topic reader/creator
	* bag play/record
	* image viewer
	* mjpeg streamer
	* keyboard controller

* pygecko: mostly classes

	* bag
	* camera calibrator
	* chatbot
	* file storage
	* messages
	* pywit
	* audio
	* zmq

Tools
---------

This directory contains several tools for the robot:

==================== ======= ================
Executable           Stable  Description
==================== ======= ================
camera_calibrate.py  Y       performs camera calibration using either a chessboard or asymmetric circle target. Target patterns are in the `patterns` folder.
topic.py             N       send various commands to the robot [work in progress]
image_view           Y       subscribe to image messages and display them for debugging
mjpeg-server         Y       create a web server which serves up an mjpeg stream from a camera. Any web browser on any device can see this stream (easier than image_view)
video.py             Y       capture images or a video clip from a camera
webserver.py         N       serve up a web page containing debugging and status info for the robot
bag_play/record      Y       saves messages to a file so they can be replayed off-line later
twist_keyboard       Y       simple keyboard interface to send twist messages to a robot
==================== ======= ================

**Note:** Please take stable with a grain of salt ... all of this is still in major development.

**Note:** There is some duplication between these, and it will eventually be sorted out.


ToDo
-----

* fix speech ... not sure best way to do this
* better modularity for various robots ... not sure how to do this
	* multiple robots use same/similar software ... not sure how to best divide things up
* ``mjpeg_server``
	* only handles one connection at a time ... make threaded?
	* sometimes the video stream is slow to load, but then it works fine
	* handle client disconnect (broken pipe - 32) better
* ``quaternions`` - use/update
* implement a simple dynamic html server that takes json data in and produces webpages of diagnostic/status info

History
-----------

``pyGecko`` comes from my previous robotics projects that I have been working
on for years. Why gecko?? I am from Florida and I remember seeing a lot of geckos
running around when I was at college ... my cats were scared of them.

Description: Gickup
        ======
        
        This is a script for backing up multiple git repos, keeping local timestamped
        copies of all available branches.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Save state of all remote branches into local branches by current date/time
        * Keep track of backed up repositories, automatic batch backup of all known repos
        * Configure repository "indices"
        
          * Scan servers for git repos to auto-add them (using ``ssh find``)
          * Scan github user for repos to auto-add them
        
        How to use
        ----------
        
        .. code:: bash
        
          # Add new repo to backup list manually
          gickup addrepo ssh://user@example.com
          gickup addrepo https://github.com/user/example.git
          gickup addrepo /some/local/path
        
          # Optionally specify a target directory
          gickup addrepo ssh://user@example.com /target/dir
        
          # Add github users / ssh server to watch for new repos
          gickup addindex --type github user
          gickup addindex github://anotheruser
          gickup addindex user@example.com:remote/path
        
          # Then scan for unknown repos
          gickup updaterepolist
          ...
        
          # Or scan without configuring
          gickup updaterepolist --type github user
          ...
          gickup updaterepolist user@example.com:remote/path
          ...
        
          # Now do a backup of all known repos
          gickup dobackup
        
          # ... or a specific one
          gickup dobackup /local/backup/path

        Why "Gickup"?
        -------------
        
        Well, every project needs a name and https://github.com/sciunto-org/gitbackup
        beat me to the obvious one.
        
        On this occasion: Thank you to the one who gave me the suggestion.

        A module that lets you monitor signals in a 
        `MyHDL <http://myhdl.org>`_ digital system simulation
        and display them as waveforms in a Jupyter notebook.
        Make changes to your digital design and see the results reflected immediately in the
        waveforms of your notebook!
        
        `myhdlpeek` uses a `Peeker` objects that monitor signals and records
        the time and value when they change.
        Just add the Peekers where you want to monitor something (even at sub-levels
        of a hierarchical design) and then view the collected timing waveforms
        with a single command.
        You can also select which signals are shown, set the beginning and
        ending times of the display, and set other options.
        
        Below are some examples of Jupyter notebooks using myhdlpeek.
        Unfortunately, Github doesn't render the waveform displays so you'll have to
        download and run the notebooks locally to see what myhdlpeek can do.

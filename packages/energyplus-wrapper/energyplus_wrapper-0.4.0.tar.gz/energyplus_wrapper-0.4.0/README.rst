energy+ wrapper
==========================

This little library has been written in order to run energy+ simulation in linux and windows with or without the use of docker image in a thread-safe way.

The main goal is to ensure a stable behaviour across platform and version, and
to make the link between the e+ building model tools written in python and the different analysis and optimization tools.

Install
=======

For now, the package is available on PyPI, and via the github repo.

.. code:: shell

    pip install energyplus-wrapper
    pip install git+git://github.com/celliern/energy_plus_wrapper.git

and

.. code:: shell

    pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/celliern/energy_plus_wrapper/master/requirements.txt

for the requirements.

this package works well when docker is properly installed and configured (https://www.docker.com/products/docker).

as fallback, a proper install of energy-plus should do the trick, with docker_tag=None on the running function. The command EnergyPlus have to be available on the path.

Docker images
=============

I have extended the work of Nicholas Long, pushing on docker hub the different version of e+ from 8.2.0 up to 8.6.0. They are accessible with the docker_tag argument of the main function (docker_tag="8.5.0" allow to run the simulation with the version 8.5.0 of energy plus).

Usage
=====

very simple use:

.. code:: python

    from energyplus_wrapper import run
    result = run('in.idf', 'in.epw')


API
===

.. code:: python

    def run(idf_file, weather_file,
            working_dir=".",
            idd_file=None,
            prefix="eplus",
            out_dir='/tmp/',
            keep_data=False,
            docker_tag='latest'):
    """
    energyplus runner using docker image (by default) or local installation.

    Run an energy-plus simulation with the model file (a .idf file),
    a weather file (should be a .epw) as required arguments. The output will be
    a pandas dataframe or a list of dataframe or None, depending of how many
    csv has been generated during the simulation, and requested in the model
    file.
    The simulation can be containerized inside a docker image (by default) or
    with local energy-plus binary. The later is not thread-safe yet and less
    stable (due to the difficulty to ensure same behaviour accross platforms.)
    # TODO: ensure same behaviour across != platform
    # TODO: ensure same behaviour with != versions

    Arguments:
        idf_file {str} -- the file describing the model (.idf)
        weather_file {str} -- the file describing the weather data (.epw)

    Keyword Arguments:
        working_dir {str} -- working directory (default: {"."})
        prefix {str} -- prefix of output file (default: {"eplus"})
        idd_file {str} -- base energy-plus file (default: {None},
            using the one provided by energy-plus)
        out_dir {str} -- output_directory (default: {"/tmp"})
        keep_data {bool} -- the data are put on temporary directory
            if False (the default), this directory is deleted after the run.
            Otherwise, the data will remain in place (default: {False})
        docker_tag {str} -- if not empty, the simulation will run containerized
            on docker image (cellier/energy_plus:{docker_tag}).
            Thanks to Nicholas Long nicholas.long@nrel.gov for the base image.
            If empty string or None, fallback to local installed e+.
            (default: {"8.4.0"})
        # TODO : write a nice tool to detect installed version of eplus
        # for the != platforms (versioning in e+ seem strange..)

    Output:
        result_dataframes {pandas.DataFrame or
                           list of pandas.DataFrame or
                           None} --
            for now, only the csv outputs are handled : the output of the
            fonction will be None if any csv are generated, a pandas DataFrame
            if only one csv is generated (which seems to be the usual user
            case) or a list of DataFrames if many csv are generated.
    """

TODO
====

* Write proper documentation
* Check the docker installation and e+ local installation and set correct default behavior.
* Continous integration via Travis
* Write better test coverage (files in.idf and in.epw are here for that).
* Ensure stability and cross-platform compatibility (I need a windows beta tester with both native install and docker!)
* Write a command-line tool (using click ?) ? Maybe not that useful..

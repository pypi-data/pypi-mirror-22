= oVirt Engine API Python SDK

== Introduction

This project contains the Python SDK for the oVirt Engine API.

== Important

Note that most of the code of this SDK is automatically generated. If
you just installed the package then you will have everything already,
but if you downloaded the source then you will need to generate it,
follow the instructions in the `README.adoc` file of the parent
directory.

== Installation

The SDK can be installed in Fedora 24 and CentOS 7 using the RPM packages
provided by the oVirt project. To do so install the oVirt release package:

  # dnf install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release41.rpm

Then install the SDK packages. For Python 2:

  # dnf install python-ovirt-engine-sdk4

For Python 3:

  # dnf install python3-ovirt-engine-sdk4

For other operating systems (and also for Fedora and CentOS) you can
install the SDK using the `pip` command, which will download the source
from https://pypi.python.org/pypi[PyPI], build and install it.

The SDK uses http://www.xmlsoft.org[libxml2] for parsing and rendering
XML. The part of the SDK that interacts with that library is written in
C. This means that before building you must make sure you have the C
compiler and the required header and libraries files installed in your
system. For example, if you are using distributions like Fedora, or
CentOS:

  # dnf -y install \
  gcc \
  libxml2-devel \
  python-devel

For Python 3:

  # dnf -y install \
  gcc \
  libxml2-devel \
  python3-devel

If you are using distributions like Debian, or Ubuntu:

  # apt-get --assume-yes install \
  gcc \
  libxml2-dev \
  python-dev

For Python 3:

  # apt-get --assume-yes install \
  gcc \
  libxml2-dev \
  python3-dev

NOTE: The examples above use the `dnf` command, which is the default in
Fedora 24. In CentOS 7 you may need to use the `yum` command, as `dnf`
is optional.

== Usage

To use the SDK import the `ovirtsdk4` module. That will give you
access to all the classes of the SDK, and in particular to the
`Connection` class. This is the entry point of the SDK,
and gives you access to the root of the tree of services of the API:

[source,python]
----
import ovirtsdk4 as sdk

# Create a connection to the server:
connection = sdk.Connection(
  url='https://engine.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
  username='admin@internal',
  password='...',
  ca_file='ca.pem',
)

# Get the reference to the system service:
system_service = connection.system_service()

# Always remember to close the connection when finished:
connection.close()
----

The `ca.pem` file is required when connecting to a server protected
with TLS. In an usual oVirt installation it will be in
`/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/ca.pem`. If you don't specify `ca_file`, then
system wide CA certificate store will be used.

Once you have the reference to the system service you can use it to get
references to other services, and call their methods. For example, to
retrieve the list of virtual machines of the system you can use the
`vms_service()` method, which returns a reference to the service that
manages the virtual machines:

[source,python]
----
# Get the reference to the "vms" service:
vms_service = system_service.vms_service()
----

This service is an instance of `VmsService`, and it has a `list` method
that returns an array of virtual machines, which are instances of the
`Vm` class:

[source,python]
----
# Retrieve the virtual machines:
vms = vms_service.list()

# Print the names and identifiers of the virtual machines:
for vm in vms:
  print("%s: %s" % (vm.name, vm.id))
----

You will find more usage examples in the `examples` directory.

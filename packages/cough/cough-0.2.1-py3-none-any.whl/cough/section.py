    VirtualAddress:
        The address of the item to which relocation is applied. This is the offset from the beginning of the section,
        plus the value of the section’s RVA/Offset field. For example, if the first byte of the section has an address
        of 0x10, the third byte has an address of 0x12.
    SymbolTableIndex:
        A zero-based index into the symbol table. This symbol gives the address that is to be used for the relocation.
        If the specified symbol has section storage class, then the symbol’s address is the address with the first
        section of the same name.
    Type:
        A value that indicates the kind of relocation that should be performed. Valid relocation types depend on
        machine type.

    Name:
        An 8-byte, null-padded UTF-8 encoded string. If the string is exactly 8 characters long, there is no
        terminating null. For longer names, this field contains a slash (/) that is followed by an ASCII
        representation of a decimal number that is an offset into the string table. Long names in object files are
        truncated if they are emitted to an executable file.
    VirtualSize:
        The total size of the section when loaded into memory. Should be set to zero.
    VirtualAddress:
        The address of the first byte of the section relative to the image base when the section is loaded into memory.
        This field is the address of the first byte before relocation is applied; for simplicity, compilers should set
        this to zero. Otherwise, it is an arbitrary value that is subtracted from offsets during relocation.
    SizeOfRawData:
        The size of the section. If this is less than VirtualSize, the remainder of the section is zero-filled. Because
        the SizeOfRawData field is rounded but the VirtualSize field is not, it is possible for SizeOfRawData to be
        greater than VirtualSize as well. When a section contains only uninitialized data, this field should be zero.
    PointerToRawData:
        The file pointer to the first page of the section within the COFF file. The value should be aligned on a 4-byte
        boundary for best performance. When a section contains only uninitialized data, this field should be zero.
    PointerToRelocations:
        The file pointer to the beginning of relocation entries for the section. This is set to zero if there are no
        relocations.
    PointerToLinenumbers:
        The file pointer to the beginning of line-number entries for the section. This is set to zero if there are no
        COFF line numbers.
    NumberOfRelocations:
        The number of relocation entries for the section.
    NumberOfLinenumbers:
        The number of line-number entries for the section.
    Characteristics:
        The flags that describe the characteristics of the section.

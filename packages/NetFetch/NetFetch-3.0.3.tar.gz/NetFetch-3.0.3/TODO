* Create a way for client to override "hostname" key
* Create a server/client setup, such that you can request a file from a server, and the daemon will fetch and store it (and optionally delete after)
* Figure out some way to integrate non-absolute paths, i.e. arbitrary key
* Think of a good way to allow deleting files. My concern is someone deleting password-protected data, but I guess they could do that manually anyway.
* README.rst/README.md documentation
* pydoc documentation

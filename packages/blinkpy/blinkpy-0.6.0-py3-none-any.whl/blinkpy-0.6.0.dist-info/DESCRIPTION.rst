Original protocol hacking by MattTW : https://github.com/MattTW/BlinkMonitorProtocol

API calls faster than 60 seconds is not recommended as it can overwhelm Blink's servers.  Please use this module responsibly.

Installation
================
``pip3 install blinkpy``

Purpose
===========
This library was built with the intention of allowing easy communication with Blink camera systems, specifically so I can add a module into homeassistant https://home-assistant.io

Usage
=========
In terms of usage, you just need to instantiate the module with a username and password

.. code:: python

    import blinkpy
    blink = blinkpy.Blink(username='YOUR USER NAME', password='YOUR PASSWORD')


If you leave out either of those parameters, you need to call the login function which will prompt for your username and password

.. code:: python

    import blinkpy
    blink = blinkpy.Blink()
    blink.login()


Once the login information is entered, you can run the `setup_system()` function which will attempt to authenticate with Blink servers using your username and password, obtain network ids, and create a list of cameras.
The cameras are of a BlinkCamera class, of which the following parameters can be used (the code below creates a Blink object and iterates through each camera found)

.. code:: python

    import blinkpy

    blink = blinkpy.Blink(username='YOUR USER NAME', password='YOUR PASSWORD')
    blink.setup_system()

    for camera in blink.cameras:
        print(camera.name)          # Name of the camera
        print(camera.id)            # Integer id of the camera (assigned by Blink)
        print(camera.armed)         # Whether the device is armed/disarmed (ie. detecting motion)
        print(camera.clip)          # Link to last motion clip captured
        print(camera.thumbnail)     # Link to current camera thumbnail
        print(camera.temperature)   # Current camera temperature (not super accurate, but might be useful for someone)
        print(camera.battery)       # Current battery level... I think the value ranges from 0-3, but not quite sure yet.
        print(camera.notifications) # Number of unread notifications (ie. motion alerts that haven't been viewed)
        print(camera.motion)        # Dictionary containing values for keys ['video', 'image', 'time']
                                    # which correspond to last motion recorded, thumbnail of last motion, and timestamp of last motion


Class Descriptions
===================                               
.. code:: python

    class Blink()

* ``Blink.cameras`` Returns a dictionary of ``BlinkCamera`` objects where the key corresponds to the camera name and the value is the actual BlinkCamera object.
* ``Blink.network_id`` Returns the current network id.
* ``Blink.account_id`` Returns the account id.
* ``Blink.events`` Returns a list of events recorded by blink.  This information will contain links to any motion caught by an armed camera..
* ``Blink.online`` Returns online status of sync module (True = online, False = offline).
* ``Blink.last_motion()`` Finds last motion information for each camera and stores it in the ``BlinkCamera.motion`` field.
* ``Blink.arm`` Set to True to arm, False to disarm.  Can be used to see the status of the system as well.
* ``Blink.refresh()`` Forces a refresh of all camera information.
* ``Blink.get_summary()`` Returns json formatted summary of the system.
* ``Blink.get_cameras()`` Finds all cameras in the system and creates ``BlinkCamera`` objects to represent them.
* ``Blink.set_links()`` Gives each BlinkCamera object the links needed to find recent images and videos.
* ``Blink.login()`` Prompts user for login information.
* ``Blink.get_auth_token()`` Uses login information to retrieve authorization token from Blink for further communication.
* ``Blink.get_ids()`` Retrieves the network_id and account_id from Blink in order to access video and image pages on their server.
* ``Blink.setup_system()`` A wrapper script that calls:
.. code:: python

    Blink.get_auth_token()
    Blink.get_ids()
    Blink.get_camers()
    Blink.set_links()

.. code:: python

  class BlinkCamera(config, urls)

The ``BlinkCamera`` class expects to receive:

* A dictionary ``config`` that contains the camera name, device id, armed status, thumbnail url, camera temperature, camery battery level, number of notifications, and region id
* A ``BlinkURLHandler`` object that contains all the links necessary for communication.

Ultimately, this class is just a wrapper for each individual camera in order to make communication with individual cameras less clunky.  The following properties/methods are availiable (in addition to the ones mentioned earlier):

* ``BlinkCamera.snap_picture()`` Takes an image with the camera and saves it as the new thumbnail.  The ``Blink.refresh()`` method should be called after this if you want to store the new thumbnail link.
* ``BlinkCamera.set_motion_detect(enable=True/False)`` Sending True to this function will enable motion detection for the camera.  Setting to False will disable motion detection.
* ``BlinkCamera.image_to_file(path)`` This will write the current thumbnail to the location indicated in 'path'
* ``BlinkCamera.image_refresh()`` Refreshes the current thumbnail.

.. code:: python

    class BlinkURLHandler(region_id)

The ``BlinkURLHandler`` class expects to be initialized with the region id found in the ``Blink.get_auth_token()`` function.  The class will then create the necessary links required for various communication.

Description: # HYDRANT
        
        Hydrant is a consumer for Software Factory's Firehose. It aims at storing events
        for later retrieval, allowing auditing.
        
        ## Running and testing
        
        Hydrant is tested against and runs on python 2.7 and python 3.5.
        
        Install the requirements like this:
        
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        And to start hydrant, run
        
        ```bash
        hydrant -c /path/to/config/file.yaml
        ```
        
        ## The configuration file
        
        Hydrant uses a yaml configuration file to define the mosquitto service to subscribe
        to, and the backend to publish to. See etc/hydrant.yaml for an example.

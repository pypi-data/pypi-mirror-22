This is the API documentation for the VIS Framework for Music Analysis.
The VIS Framework is a Python package that uses music21 and pandas to 
build a flexible and easy system for writing symbolic music analysis 
computer programs.

By providing a free-and-open solution (AGPLv3+) we hope to lower the 
barrier to empirical music analysis. The VIS Framework was developed at 
McGill University as part of the ELVIS Project (http://elvisproject.ca).
VIS has been presented at conferences, including the International 
Society for Music Information Retrieval and the Society for Music Theory.

About This Documentation
------------------------

The API is written for programmers interested in symbolic music information retrieval (i.e., music theory analysis performed by computers).
Musicologists and programmers alike may access our VIS client at `vis-rodan.simssa.ca <https://vis-rodan.simssa.ca>`_, and some of our research findings from the `ELVIS Project's website <https://elvisproject.ca/research/>`_.

The rest of the documentation discusses the VIS Framework's architecture, how to install and use the framework, and how to add your own analysis tasks.

One-Paragraph Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The VIS Framework uses two data models (:class:`~vis.models.indexed_piece.IndexedPiece` and :class:`~vis.models.aggregated_pieces.AggregatedPieces`) to fetch results for one or multiple pieces, respectively.
Call their :meth:`~vis.models.indexed_piece.IndexedPiece.get_data` method with a list of analyzer classes to run, and a dictionary with their settings.
After you develop an analysis workflow, add it to the :class:`~vis.workflow.WorkflowManager` for more consistent operation.

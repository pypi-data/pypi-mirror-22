******************************************

If you find asyncoro useful, please consider contrbuting to the
project.

The source code is available on GitHub. Here are a few suggestions (of
course, you can implement anything else you need, or any pet idea!):

   1. More examples (real-world, academic, or demonstrative
      examples) can be added. Multi-agent systems, evolutionary /
      genetic computing, for example, can be implemented with
      *Distributed Communicating Processes (discoro)*.

   2. Documentation can be improved.

   3. Support for fault tolerance can be added to Scheduler.

   4. Different schedulers (priority scheduling?) in asyncoro (for
      concurrency), or discoro (for managing distributed coroutines)
      can be tried.

   5. Name resolution of resources is not currently cached, so if,
      for example, a coroutine is located again, asyncoro sends lookup
      request and waits for results. Caching can improve performance,
      but it means resources may need to be validated (periodically),
      pruned if too many resources are cached etc. Alternatley,
      external libraries such as Redis can be supported to store
      location information of resources.

   6. Comments in the code with 'TODO' are ideas / improvements /
      potential issues; these can be addressed.

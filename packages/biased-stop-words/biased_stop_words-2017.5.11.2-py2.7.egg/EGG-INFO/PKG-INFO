        Overview
        --------
        
        Stop words are words which are filtered out before processing of natural language data. Often in text analysis there are non-casual correlations, consider the following documents:
        
        - He is an astronaut, he is on Venus
        - He is an accountant, he is on Earth
        - She is an astronaut, she is on Mars
        
        Processing these documents into two topics will result in gendered clustering. If we remove the gendered terms:
        
        - is an astronaut, is on Venus
        - is an accountant, is on Earth
        - is an astronaut, is on Mars
        
        Processing will result in job clustering. Both clusterings are valid, however if you are interested in employing an astronaut, you don't want male accountants showing up.
        
        Available genres
        ----------------
        
        * English Gendered Terms
        * US names
        
        More will be available soon. Contribute at https://github.com/gregology/biased-stop-words

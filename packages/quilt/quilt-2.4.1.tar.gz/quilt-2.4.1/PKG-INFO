Description: 
            [Quilt] is a data package manager.
            `quilt` is a command-line tool that builds, retrieves, and stores
            data packages. A data package is a namespace of binary data frames
            (and files).
        
            `quilt` works in conjunction with a server-side registry,
            not covered in this document. `quilt` currently pushes to and pulls from
            the registry at [quiltdata.com](https://quiltdata.com/). In the near
            future users will be able to browse packages in the registry. You can
            use the registry to install data packages from the community, or publish
            packages for others to use.

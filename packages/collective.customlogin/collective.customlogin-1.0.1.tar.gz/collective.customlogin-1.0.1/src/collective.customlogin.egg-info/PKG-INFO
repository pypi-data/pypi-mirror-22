Description: CustomLogin
        ===========
        
        A way to customise the login behaviour by using content rules. Content rules
        can now be triggered by a Unauhtorised trigger and new Redirect action allows
        adminstrators to send users to a custom form or another site. Rules can be
        created to redirect unauthorised users based on the content location, current
        groups or permissions or any other content rule criteria. Because the redirect action uses 
        a tal expression you can include any additional information you need for you 
        custom login process.
        
        Examples
        --------
        Filling out a form to download a pdf. This can be achieved via creating a rule 
        that redirects to a PloneFormGen form and then applying the content rule to the 
        private content objects you want to protect. Using a PFG script adapter,Plomino or Rapido, you
        can use something like tokenrole to give permission to original object once
        the user has filled out the form correctly. 
        
        Technical
        ---------
        
        A PAS challenge that raises an event so that a custom event handler can 
        issue a redirect, allowing for custom login pages.
        
        Provides a ContentRule and a ContentAction so that redirects can be managed via
        content rules.

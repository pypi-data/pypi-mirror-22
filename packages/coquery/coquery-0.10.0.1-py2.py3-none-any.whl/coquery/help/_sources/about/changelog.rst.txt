This release is a considerable update over earlier versions. These are the
main fields that have seen large changes:

* the interface has been redesigned and streamlined
* a completely new data management system, including a revised way of
  handling functions
* the new visualization designer allows interactive construction of figures
  from the query results

Here is an incomplete list of most of the things that have changed or have
been added.

Interface
=========

* interface resdesign:

  - move column selection to the left as 'Data features'
  - place Query button more prominently in the middle, and rename it
  - replace Aggregation widget by 'Data management' toolbox
  
* add new dialogs to the 'Help' menu:

  - regular expression tester
  - 'How to cite' dialog
  - module information dialog

* simplify query file widget
* collect hidden columns in a side bar
* there is now a search widget
* change 'Query' button to 'New query'
* make keyboard shortcuts more consistent
* add value substitutions
* improve TextGrid export features
* use Icons8 icon set
* add user data columns
* external links are now persistent when changing the corpus or quitting the
  program
* group and summary functions are now saved on quitting the program
* greatly improve the speed of browsing the results table
* placeholder for empty cells is now configurable

Data management
===============

* the displayed context can now be changed after the query
* add option to restrict contexts to sentence boundaries
* functions are now added to columns in the results table
* add completely revised filter dialog
* add completely revised functions dialog
* introduce data groups, which can split the results into subsets and allow
  functions to act only on the subsets
* introduce Group and Summary functions (the latter replaces the Statistics
  special table)
* add new data functions (Subcorpus size, Frequency ptw, Normalized frequency,
  Number of matches, Number of unique matches, Row number, Type-token ratio)
* add new string functions (CHAIN, UPPER, LOWER), use regex for COUNT
* make regular expression function generally more robust
* add logical functions (ADD, EQUAL, GREATER, GREATEREQUAL, LESS, LESSTHAN,
  NOTEQUAL, AND, OR, XOR)
* add G-test matrix (using corrected probabilities for highlighting)
* add test statistics (log-likelihood test, chi-square test) and effect
  sizes (phi coefficient, odds ratio)
* show both left and right conditional probabilities in Collocations
  aggregation
* add stopword lists for many languages

Visualization
=============
* introduce the Visualization designer
* add new visualizations: heatbar plot, regression plot, scatter plot,
  violin plot, box-whisker plot
* allow vertical plots where sensible

Corpora
=======
* add reference corpus support
* provide functions that use the reference corpus (Keyness LL, Keyness %DIFF,
  as well as frequency functions in the reference corpus)
* big change for corpora that provide audio (currently, only Buckeye is
  supported):

  - add spectrogram and waveform contexts
  - store audio in databases
  - allow audio playback

* improve segment lookup in corpora that contain segments
* allow to build 'corpora' from CSV files
* add support for encoding detection when reading plain text files

Queries
=======
* internal change: rewrite SQL code generator, which speeds up multi-word queries
* allow regular expression queries (can be activated in the settings)
* introduction of _NULL special query item (issue #97)
* introduction of _PUNCT special query item as a placeholder for any
  punctuation mark
* add query cache that can speed up repeated queries (experimental)

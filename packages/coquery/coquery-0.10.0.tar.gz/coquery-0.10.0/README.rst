Coquery - a free corpus query tool
==================================

Coquery is a free corpus query tool for linguists, lexicographers,
translators, and anybody who wishes to search and analyse text corpora.
It is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X computers.

You can either build your own corpus from a collection of text files (either 
PDF, MS Word, OpenDocument, HTML, or plain text) in a directory on your 
computer, or install a corpus module for one of the supported corpora (the 
corpus data files are not provided by Coquery).

Features
--------

An incomplete list of the things you can do with Coquery:

Corpora
~~~~~~~

-  Use the corpus manager to install one of the supported corpora
-  Build your own corpus from PDF, HTML, .docx, .odt, or plain text files
-  Filter your query for example by year, genre, or speaker gender
-  Choose which corpus features will be included in your query results
-  View every token that matches your query within its context

Queries
~~~~~~~

-  Match tokens by orthography, phonetic transcription, lemma, or gloss,
   and restrict your query by part-of-speech
-  Use string functions e.g. to test if a token contains a letter
   sequence
-  Use the same query syntax for all installed corpora
-  Automate queries by reading them from an input file
-  Save query results from speech corpora as Praat TextGrids

Analysis
~~~~~~~~

-  Summarize the query results as frequency tables or contingency tables
-  Calculate entropies and relative frequencies
-  Fetch collocations, and calculate association statistics like mutual
   information scores or conditional probabilities

Visualizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Use bar charts, heat maps, or bubble charts to visualize frequency
   distributions
-  Illustrate diachronic changes by using time series plots
-  Show the distribution of tokens within a corpus in a barcode or a
   beeswarm plot

Databases
~~~~~~~~~

-  Either connect to easy-to-use internal databases, or to powerful
   MySQL servers
-  Access large databases on a MySQL server over the network
-  Create links between tables from different corpora, e.g. to provide
   phonetic transcriptions for tokens in an unannotated corpus

If the list is missing a corpus that you want to see supported in Coquery, 
you can either write your own corpus installer in Python using the installer 
API, or you can [contact](http://www.coquery.org/contact) the Coquery 
maintainers and ask them for assistance.

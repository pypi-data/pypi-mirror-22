        * ``CoalaIp.generate_user()``: Create a user representation suitable for use
          with ``coalaip``
        * ``CoalaIp.register_manifestation()``: Registering a ``Manifestation`` (and
          along with it, an associated parent ``Work`` and a ``Copyright`` of the

        History
        =======
        
        0.0.3 (2017-05-06)
        ------------------
        
        Some changes during the OMI hackfest!
        
        * Make creation of Work and Copyright optional when registering
          a Manifestation.
        
        
        0.0.2 (2017-05-05)
        ------------------
        
        Some changes during the OMI hackfest!
        
        Some highlights:
        
        * Add `register_work` method to enable registering a work without
          necessarily registering a manifestation.
        
        
        0.0.1 (2017-02-17)
        ------------------
        
        First alpha release on PyPI.
        
        Additional features added with no backwards-incompatible interface changes.
        COALA IP models are backwards-incompatible to previous versions due to upgrades
        related to spec changes.
        
        Some highlights:
        
        * Queryability of an Entity's ownership history and current owner
        * Entities can be given a custom ``@id``
        * Additional sanity checks employed when deriving Rights, to ensure that a
          correct source Right and current holder are given
        * Update COALA IP models to latest spec
        * Added usage documentation
        
        
        0.0.1.dev3 (2016-12-06)
        -----------------------
        
        Lots of changes and revisions from 0.0.1.dev2. Totally incompatible from
        before.
        
        Some highlights:
        
        * Implemented Rights derivation (from existing Rights and Copyrights)
        * Implemented Rights transfers
        * Entities are now best-effort immutable
        * Support for loading Entities from a connected persistence layer
        
        0.0.1.dev2 (2016-08-31)
        -----------------------
        
        * Fix packaging on PyPI
        
        0.0.1.dev1 (2016-08-31)
        -----------------------
        
        * Development (pre-alpha) release on PyPI.

TheHive4py
==========

TheHive4py is a Python API client for
`TheHive <https://thehive-project.org/>`__, a scalable 3-in-1 open
source and free security incident response platform designed to make
life easier for SOCs, CSIRTs, CERTs and any information security
practitioner dealing with security incidents that need to be
investigated and acted upon swiftly.

TheHive4py allows analysts to create cases out of different sources such
as email. For example, a SOC may ask its constituency to send suspicious
email reports to a specific mailbox that a script polls at regular
intervals. When a new email is received, the script parses it then calls
TheHive4py to create a corresponding case in TheHive. Once the case has
been created, SOC analysts will get a notification thanks to TheHive's
Flow so they can start investigating the new case.

Caution - WIP
=============

TheHive4py is a work in progress. It is considered *beta* software
though we are using it on a regular basis for the use case outlined
above. The client doesn't leverage yet the richness of TheHive's REST
API (which is `partially
documented <https://github.com/CERT-BDF/TheHive/wiki/API%20documentation>`__)
but it should be sufficient in most situations. If not, please feel free
to contribute and submit pull requests or `request missing
features <https://github.com/CERT-BDF/TheHive4py/issues/new>`__ if you
are not comfortable with Python.

======

On macOS and Linux, type:

        Features
        --------
        
        -  Use **filters** to list/start/stop/remove/... torrents matching any
           combination of criteria
        -  **Tabs** with different lists, documentation, etc
        -  Everything is done via **commands**, and they are invoked
        
           -  through single- or multi-key (think emacs) **keybindings**,
           -  by entering them in a **command prompt** (think vi),
           -  by providing them as **CLI arguments** in your interactive shell
              or in **scripts**,
           -  or by listing them in an **rc file**.
        
        -  Support for **themes** with 16 and 256 colors
        -  **Complete built-in documentation** with ``help`` command
        -  Full **API abstraction layer** makes it possible to add support for
           other BitTorrent clients with RPC interfaces
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        Add two torrents (file and hash) and exit
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ stig add /path/to/some.torrent d4d6b73851fe3288e40389a8e1fb98124a9b9ba5
        
        Connect to non-default host and present the TUI
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ stig set srv.url torrents.local:1234
        
        Print all uploading and/or downloading torrents on torrents.local and
        exit
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ stig set srv.url torrents.local \; ls active
        
        List torrents with more than 50 seeds, then remove them
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ stig ls 'seeds>50'
            $ stig rm 'seeds>50'
        
        Stop/pause torrents with ``/foo/`` in their download path and a ratio
        above 10
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ stig stop 'path~/foo/&ratio>10'
        
        Open two tabs with different torrent lists:
        
        -  slowly uploading torrents with ``/foo/`` in their download path
        -  small or well-seeded torrents, sorted by size (ascending) and number
           of seeds (descending)
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ stig tab ls 'path~/foo/&rate-up<10k' \; tab ls 'size<500M|seeds>=1k' --sort 'size,!seeds'
        
        Configuration and Scripting
        ---------------------------
        
        All configuration is done in ``$HOME/.config/stig/rc``. Each line is a
        command that is called during startup. Commands given as CLI arguments
        are called after the rc commands.
        
        Example ``$HOME/.config/stig/rc``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            # Host that runs Transmission daemon
            set srv.url otherhost:123
        
            # Poll every 10 seconds
            set tui.poll 10
        
            # Default columns in torrent lists
            set columns.torrents name ratio rate-up rate-down
        
            # Open a few tabs
            tab ls active --sort !progress,path,!rate
            tab ls paused --sort !progress --columns name,progress,ratio,size
            tab ls isolated --sort tracker --columns name,path
        
        You can have different rc files and run them either with
        ``stig -c path/to/file`` or by using the shebang ``#!/path/to/stig -Tc``
        (``-T`` disables the TUI, ``-c`` specifies the rc file) to turn them
        into executables.
        
        Example maintenance script
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            #!/home/ich/.local/bin/stig -Tc
            rm path=/path/to/torrents/trash
            pause seeds>100
            start seeds<20&size>10G|seeds<50&size>20G

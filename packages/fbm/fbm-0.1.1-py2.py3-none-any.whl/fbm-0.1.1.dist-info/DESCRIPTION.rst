fbm
===

Exact methods for simulating fractional Brownian motion (fBm) or fractional
Gaussian noise (fGn) in python.

The three methods are Hosking's method, the Cholesky method, and the Davies
Harte method. All three methods are exact in generating a discretely sampled
fBm/fGn.

Installation:

.. code-block::

    pip install fbm

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

    from fbm import FBM


    f = FBM(n=16, hurst=0.75, length=1, method='daviesharte')

    # Generate a fBm realization
    fbm_sample = f.fbm()

    # Generate a fGn realization
    fgn_sample = f.fgn()

    # Get the times associated with the fBm
    t_values = f.times()

where ``n`` is the number of equispaced increments desired for a fBm with Hurst
parameter ``hurst`` on the interval [0, ``length``]. Method can be
either ``'hosking'``, ``'cholesky'``, or ``'daviesharte'``. The ``fbm()``
method returns a length ``n+1`` array of discrete values for the fBm (includes
0). The ``fgn()`` method returns a length ``n`` array of fBm
increments, or fGn. The ``times()`` method returns a length ``n+1`` array of
times corresponding to the fBm realizations.

For simulating multiple realizations use the FBM class provided as above.
For one-off samples of fBm or fGn there are also functions available which
handle the FBM object themselves:

.. code-block:: python

    from fbm import fbm, fgn, times


    # Generate a fBm realization
    fbm_sample = fbm(n=16, hurst=0.75, length=1, method='daviesharte')

    # Generate a fGn realization
    fgn_sample = fgn(n=16, hurst=0.75, length=1, method='daviesharte')

    # Get the times associated with the fBm
    t_values = times(n=16, length=1)

For fastest performance use the Davies and Harte method. It is much faster than
both other methods especially for larger increment quantities. Note that the
Davies and Harte method can fail if the Hurst parameter ``hurst`` is close to
1 and there are a small amount of increments ``n``. If this occurs, python will
print a warning to the console and fallback to using Hosking's method to
generate the realization. See page 412 of the following paper for a more

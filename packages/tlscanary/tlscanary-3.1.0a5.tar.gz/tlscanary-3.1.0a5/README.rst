TLS Canary
==========

TLS Canary is a `TLS/SSL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security>`_ testing framework for the
`Mozilla Firefox <https://www.mozilla.org/firefox>`_ web browser. It is used by developers to run regression and
performance tests against a huge number of HTTPS-enabled hosts on the internet.

--------

The TLS Canary Python package has several non-Python dependencies that need to be satisfied for the script to run.
For installation instructions, usage information, and issue tracking, please refer to the `TLS Canary Project Page
<https://github.com/mozilla/tls-canary>`_ on GitHub.

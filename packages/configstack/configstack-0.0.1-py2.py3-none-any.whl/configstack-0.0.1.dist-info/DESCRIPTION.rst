ConfigStack is a Python library for stacking program configuration:

* Command-line options, defined with `argparse`.

* Environment variables, derived from other configuration options.

* Configuration files, defined with `configparser`.

* Default values.

These are all unified at run time, in a single collection of settings
for the program to use.

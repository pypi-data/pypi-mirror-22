Description: ====================================
        SerialLibrary for Robot Framework
        ====================================
        
        This is a serial port test library for Robot Framework.
        
        
        Example::
        
            *** settings ***
            Library    SerialLibrary    loop://    encoding=ascii
        
            *** test cases ***
            Hello serial test
                 Write Data    Hello World
                 Read Data Should Be    Hello World
        
        
        Another Example::
        
            *** settings ***
            Library    SerialLibrary
        
            *** test cases ***
            Read Until should read until terminator or size
                [Setup]    Add Port    loop://    timeout=0.1
                ${bytes} =    Set Variable    
                Write Data    01 23 45 0A 67 89 AB CD EF
                ${read} =    Read Until
                Should Be Equal As Strings    ${read}    01 23 45 0A
                ${read} =    Read Until   size=2
                Should Be Equal As Strings    ${read}    67 89
                ${read} =    Read Until   terminator=CD
                Should Be Equal As Strings    ${read}    AB CD
                ${read} =    Read Until
                Should Be Equal As Strings    ${read}    EF
                ${read} =    Read Until
                Should Be Equal As Strings    ${read}    ${EMPTY}
                [Teardown]    Delete All Ports

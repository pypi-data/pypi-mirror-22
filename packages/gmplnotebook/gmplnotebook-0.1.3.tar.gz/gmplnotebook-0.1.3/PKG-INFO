Description: GMPL Notebook: A GMPL/MathProg Kernel for Jupyter
        =================================================
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Take a look at these `example
        notebooks <https://github.com/nelsonuhan/gmplnotebookexamples>`__ for
        details on how to use GMPL Notebook â€” no installation required, thanks
        to `Binder <http://mybinder.org>`__!
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        GMPL Notebook has been tested with
        
        -  Jupyter 4.2.0
        -  Python 3.5.2
        -  MetaKernel 0.14
        -  PyGLPK 0.4.2, available from
           [@bradfordboyle](https://github.com/bradfordboyle/pyglpk)
        -  GLPK 4.60
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        First, make sure you have a working installation of GLPK. For example,
        on macOS, this can be accomplished with `Homebrew <http://brew.sh>`__
        by:
        
        ::
        
            brew update
            brew tap homebrew/science
            brew install glpk
        
        (I will eventually include instructions on how to install GLPK on other
        operating systems.)
        
        Next, install PyGLPK - note that the version on PyPI is outdated:
        
        ::
        
            pip install https://github.com/bradfordboyle/pyglpk/zipball/master
        
        Then, install GMPL Notebook:
        
        ::
        
            pip install gmplnotebook
            python -m gmplnotebook install --user
        
        GMPL/MathProg should now appear as an option when creating new notebooks
        in Jupyter.

Current features
----------------

* **network topology collector** supporting different formats:
    - NetJSON NetworkGraph
    - OLSR (jsoninfo/txtinfo)
    - batman-adv (jsondoc/txtinfo)
    - BMX6 (q6m)
    - CNML 1.0
    - additional formats can be added by `specifying custom parsers <#netjsongraph-parsers>`_
* **network topology visualizer** based on `netjsongraph.js <https://github.com/netjson/netjsongraph.js>`_
* **simple HTTP API** that exposes data in `NetJSON <http://netjson.org>`__ *NetworkGraph* format
* **admin interface** that allows to easily manage, audit and debug topologies and their relative data (nodes, links)
* **receive topology** from multiple nodes

Project goals
-------------

* make it easy to visualize network topology data for the formats supported by `netdiff <https://github.com/ninuxorg/netdiff>`_
* expose topology data via RESTful resources in *NetJSON NetworkGraph* format
* make it easy to integrate in larger django projects to improve reusability
* make it easy to extend its models by providing abstract models (**needs improvement in this point**)
* provide ways to customize or replace the visualizer (**needs improvement in this point**)
* keep the core very simple
* provide ways to extend the default behaviour
* encourage new features to be published as extensions

Install stable version from pypi
--------------------------------

Install from pypi:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install django-netjsongraph

Install development version
---------------------------

Install tarball:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install https://github.com/netjson/django-netjsongraph/tarball/master

Alternatively you can install via pip using git:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install -e git+git://github.com/netjson/django-netjsongraph#egg=django-netjsongraph

If you want to contribute, install your cloned fork:

.. code-block:: shell

    git clone git@github.com:<your_fork>/django-netjsongraph.git
    cd django-netjsongraph
    python setup.py develop

Setup (integrate in an existing django project)
-----------------------------------------------

Add ``rest_framework`` and ``django_netjsongraph`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # other apps
        'rest_framework',
        'django_netjsongraph'
        # ...
    ]

Include urls in your urlconf (you can change the prefixes
according to your needs):

.. code-block:: python

    from django.conf.urls import include, url

    from django_netjsongraph.api import urls as netjsongraph_api
    from django_netjsongraph.visualizer import urls as netjsongraph_visualizer

    urlpatterns = [
        # your URLs ...
        url(r'^api/', include(netjsongraph_api)),
        url(r'', include(netjsongraph_visualizer)),
    ]

Create database tables::

    ./manage.py migrate

Management Commands
-------------------

``update_topology``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After topology URLs (URLs exposing the files that the topology of the network) have been
added in the admin, the ``update_topology`` management command can be used to collect data
and start playing with the network graph::

    ./manage.py update_topology

The management command accepts a ``--label`` argument that will be used to search in
topology labels, eg::

    ./manage.py update_topology --label mytopology

Logging
-------

The ``update_topology`` management command will automatically try to log errors.

For a good default ``LOGGING`` configuration refer to the `test settings
<https://github.com/netjson/django-netjsongraph/blob/master/tests/settings.py#L66>`_.

Strategies
----------

There are mainly two ways of collecting topology information:

* **FETCH** strategy
* **RECEIVE** strategy

Each ``Topology`` instance has a ``strategy`` field which can be set to the desired setting.

FETCH strategy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Topology data will be fetched from a URL.

When some links are not detected anymore they will be flagged as "down" straightaway.

RECEIVE strategy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Topology data is sent directly from one or more nodes of the network.

The collector waits to receive data in the payload of a POST HTTP request;
when such a request is received, a ``key`` parameter it's first checked against
the ``Topology`` key.

If the request is authorized the collector proceeds to update the topology.

If the data is sent from one node only, it's highly advised to set the
``expiration_time`` of the ``Topology`` instance to ``0`` (seconds), this way the
system works just like in the **FETCH strategy**, with the only difference that
the data is sent by one node instead of fetched by the collector.

If the data is sent from multiple nodes, you **SHOULD** set the ``expiration_time``
of the ``Topology`` instance to a value slightly higher than the interval used
by nodes to send the topology, this way links will be flagged as "down" only if
they haven't been detected for a while. This mechanism allows to visualize the
topology even if the network has been split in several parts, the disadvantage
is that it will take a bit more time to detect links that go offline.

Settings
--------

``NETJSONGRAPH_PARSERS``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

+--------------+-------------+
| **type**:    | ``list``    |
+--------------+-------------+
| **default**: | ``[]``      |
+--------------+-------------+

Additional custom `netdiff parsers <https://github.com/ninuxorg/netdiff#parsers>`_.

``NETJSONGRAPH_SIGNALS``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

+--------------+-------------+
| **type**:    | ``str``     |
+--------------+-------------+
| **default**: | ``None``    |
+--------------+-------------+

String representing python module to import on initialization.

Useful for loading django signals or to define custom behaviour.

``NETJSONGRAPH_TIMEOUT``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

+--------------+-------------+
| **type**:    | ``int``     |
+--------------+-------------+
| **default**: | ``8``       |
+--------------+-------------+

Timeout when fetching topology URLs.

``NETJSONGRAPH_LINK_EXPIRATION``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

+--------------+-------------+
| **type**:    | ``int``     |
+--------------+-------------+
| **default**: | ``60``      |
+--------------+-------------+

If a link is down for more days than this number, it will be deleted by the
``update_topology`` management command.

Setting this to ``False`` will disable this feature.

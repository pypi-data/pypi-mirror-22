Converter for Zarnegar Encoding and File Format to Unicode Text
===============================================================

Homepage: https://github.com/behnam/python-zarnegar-converter

`Zarnegar`_ (Persian: *زرنگار*, zarnegār, meaning gold-depicting) is a
commercial, stand-alone Persian/Arabic word processor program developed for
MS-DOS and Windows.  The first version of Zarnegar (for DOS), was released in
April-May 1991, and Windows versions have been available since 2000.

Zarnegar has employed two different character sets and file formats.

-----------------------
Zarnegar1 Character Set
-----------------------

Zarnegar used an `Iran System`_-based character encoding system, named
*Zarnegar1*, with text file formats for its early versions, up to its "Zarnegar
75" version.  *Zarnegar1* character set is a *2-form left-to-right visual
encoding*, meaning the every `Perso-Arabic`_ letter receives different
character codes based on its cursive joining form, but most letters receive
only 2 forms, because of the limited code-points available2 forms, because of
the limited code-points available.

This project has a partial implementation of `Zarnegar1`_ encoding
(`zarnegar_converter/zar1_encoding.py`) and a full implementation of its binary
and text file formats (`zarnegar_converter/zar1_file.py`).

------------------------
Zarnegar75 Character Set
------------------------

With "Zarnegar 75" version of the program, a new character encoding system was
introduced, and the file format was changed to another binary format.
*Zarnegar75* character set is a 4-form bidirectional encoding, meaning that
every `Perso-Arabic`_ letter receives one, two, or four character code,
depending on its cursive joining form, and these letters are stored in the
memory in the semantic order.

Support for *Zarnegar75* file format and encoding is still in progress.

pull requests.

The encoding mappings (both Zarnegar1 and Zarnegar75) can be improved with
access to more sample files. Please write to <behnam@zwnj.org> if you like to
contribute (private or public) Zarnegar source files to improve this project.

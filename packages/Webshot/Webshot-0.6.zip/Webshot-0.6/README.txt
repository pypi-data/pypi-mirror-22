A python wrapper for the NodeJS module Pagres CLI. Built and tested in Python 2.7.
Requires the NodeJS package installed: https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres-cli


I had tried a few different python screenshot modules and could not find one that 'just worked'. 


Install: pip install Webshot

Description: Calico is a utility for checking command-line programs in terms of their
        input and output. It checks whether a program generates the correct output
        when given some inputs. It was developed to evaluate simple programming
        assignments in an introductory programming course.

        Calico has been tested with Python 3.4. You can install the latest version
        from PyPI::
        
           pip install calico
        
        Calico uses `pexpect`_ for interacting with the program it is checking.
        The file that specifies the inputs and outputs for the checks
        is in `YAML`_ format.

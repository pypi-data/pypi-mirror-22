Aims:
-----

The aim of this project is to create a generic open source microscope
control package. The plan is to have two separable components, one to
drive the microscope and a second gui front end. The microscope
driving component will be fully scriptable and not reliant on the gui
for its functionality, but the gui will implement a flexible and
powerful front end for microscope users.



History:
-------

Over several years we have been involved in building a number of
bespoke optical setups. A number of these have been in collaboration
with John Sedat and his group at UCSF. They developed Cockpit, a easy to drive
microscope front end written in Python. We have done extensive work
adding additional hardware support, bug fixing, and improving the
front end. The system has grown beyond its design assumptions and we are
therefore trying to start again to have a more sustainable code base
for the future.

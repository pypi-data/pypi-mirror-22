Managing Authorization Group Restrictions
===============================================

Prior to managing certificate-based topic authorization group restrictions, a Certificate Authority (CA) that is being
used to sign client certificates or the certificate for a client must be imported into ePO.

If you have not imported a Certificate Authority (CA) or certificate, please follow the steps outlined in
the :doc:`epocaimport` section. Also if you have not created a topic authorization group, please follow the steps in
the :doc:`topicauthgroupcreation` section.

The following section walks through the steps of limiting which Certificate Authorities (CAs) and/or certificates are
required to send and receive messages for a topic authorization group::


1. Navigate to **Server Settings** and select the **Topic Authorization** setting on the left navigation bar.

The LOFAR Transients Pipeline (or "TraP") is a Python and SQL based system for
detecting and responding to transient and variable sources in a stream of
astronomical images. It primarily targets LOFAR data, but is also applicable
to a range of other instruments.  See the `pipeline documentation`_ for
details including `key features`_, installation instructions and a
usage guide.

An overview of the TraP can be found in the `TraP paper`_ accompanying
release 2.0, and we also have an assigned ASCL ID (http://ascl.net/1412.011).
If you make use of TraP in work leading to a publication, we ask that you cite
these references.


TraP development is coordinated by `The LOFAR Transients Key Science Project`_.

Bug tracking and feature requests are handled through the repository `issue
tracker`_. Contributions are welcome.

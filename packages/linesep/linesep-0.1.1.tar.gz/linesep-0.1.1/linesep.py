Handling lines with arbitrary separators

This module provides basic functions for reading & writing text with custom
line separators that can occur either before, between, or after lines â€” though
its primary purpose is actually to allow me to experiment with proper Python
packaging & testing procedures.  Being actually useful is not its #1 goal.

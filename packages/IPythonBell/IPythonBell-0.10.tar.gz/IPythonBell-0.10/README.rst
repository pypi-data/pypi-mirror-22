About
-----

IPython Bell is a simple magic for IPython and Jupyter Notebooks, which
notifies yoy when the current line/cell has finished execution. This is
particularly useful for long tasks. It can make sounds or even make
notification bubbles pop up.

Installation
------------

IPython bell can be installed as a standard Python package: either from
PyPI:

::

    pip install IPythonBell

or from git:

::

    git clone http://github.com/samwhitehall/ipython-bell.git 
    cd ipython-bell/
    python setup.py install

This can be imported into an IPython shell session using either:
``import ipython_bell`` or ``%load_ext ipython_bell``

Although you probably want it to load when IPython loads, in which case,
edit your IPython profile file (by default
``~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py``) and add
``ipython_bell`` to :

::

    c.TerminalIPythonApp.extensions = [
        'ipython_bell'
    ]

(you may need to create this, and can do so with
``ipython profile create``).

Usage
-----

This can be used as a magic for a single line (line magic):

::

    In [1]: %bell print 'hello'
    hello

or across multiple lines (cell magic):

::

    In[2]: %%bell
    import time
    time.sleep(5)

There are four currently available notifiers, selectable with the ``-n``
or ``--notifier`` arguments: 

- **Terminal Bell** ``term``: prints an audible bell character to ``stdout`` (doesnâ€™t work in Notebook). 
- **Say** ``say``: play a system sound & use text-to-speech.
- **Notification** ``notify``: (default) operating system notification  with sound.
- **Silent Notification** ``notify-silent``: operating notification without sound 


Specified as follows (in this case, for ``notify``):

::

    In [1]: %bell -n notify print 'hello'
    hello

    In[2]: %%bell -n notify
    import time
    time.sleep(5)


Compatibility
-------------

- **MacOS**: should work out of the box. 

- **Linux**: you may need to install ``beep`` and/or ``libnotify``.

- **Windows**: *entirely untested*, so please create an issue if it doesn't work (notifications only designed to work work on Windows 10+).

1.1.0 (2017-05-25)
------------------
- [IMP] pylint: BREAKING the package to test must be provided explicitly,
  as soon as additional pylint options are provided,
  so as to enable easy local testing of a subset of a project. Examples:
  ``acsoo pylint -- -d some-message odoo``, ``acsoo pylint -- odoo.addons.xyz``
- [IMP] pylint: disable more code complexity errors: ``too-many-nested-blocks``,
  ``too-many-return-statements``
- [IMP] pylint: display messages causing failure last, so emails from CI
  that show the last lines of the log are more relevant
- [IMP] pylint: display summary of messages that did not cause failure, also
  when there is no failure
- [ADD] ``acsoo addons list`` and ``acsoo addons list-depends``
- [ADD] ``acsoo checklog``

1.0.1 (2017-05-21)
------------------
- First public release.

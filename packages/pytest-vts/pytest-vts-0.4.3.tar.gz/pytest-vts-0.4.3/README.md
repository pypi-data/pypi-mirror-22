[![PyPi version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pytest-vts.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-vts/)

Automatic recorder for http stubbed [pytest][](s) using [responses][]
library. VTS stands for Video Tests System and has been inspired from
[VHS][Videotape format war wiki].



# How to use it

  1. Add as dependency/Install via pip:
  - from PyPI (**recommended**): `pytest-vts`
    - `pip install pytest-vts`
    - `echo 'pytest-vts' >> requirements.txt`

  - from github: `git+https://github.com/bhodorog/pytest-vts.git`
    - `pip install git+https://github.com/bhodorog/pytest-vts.git`
    - `echo 'git+https://github.com/bhodorog/pytest-vts.git' >> requirements.txt`

  *Note: During installation [pytest][] is automatically installed as
   well if missing.*

  2. Once installed the package provides a [pytest fixture][] named `vts`which
  you can use for your tests.

## Simple example, showing available assertions

### Source Code

```python
# content of github_client.py
import requests

def list_repositories(user="bhodorog"):
    url = "https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=user:{}".format(user)
    headers = {"Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json"}
    resp = requests.get(url, headers)
    return resp


# content of test_github_client.py

def test_list_repositories(vts):
    github_client.list_repositories()
    assert vts.responses  # exposes underlying responses requests mock

    # asserts vs any information normally exposed by responses
    assert vts.responses.calls
    assert vts.responses.calls[0].request
    assert vts.responses.calls[0].request.url
    assert vts.responses.calls[0].response
    assert vts.responses.calls[0].response.headers
    # look at responses' documentation/code for more available info to assert against

    # you can asserts vs vts' recorded cassete as well
    # since it's just json based duplicated information, using exposed
    # responses instead might be better code style
    assert vts.cassette[0]["request"]
    assert vts.cassette[0]["request"]["url"]
    assert vts.cassette[0]["response"]
    assert vts.cassette[0]["response"]["headers"]

```

### Command line usage

```bash
$ ls ./cassettes
ls: ./cassettes: No such file or directory
$ ls ./
github_client.py test_github_client.py 
# recording
$ py.test test_github_client.py::test_func
# vts will use requests library to forward the request to
# api.github.com and save the request-response pair into a cassette
$ ls ./cassettes
test_list_repositories.json

# playback-ing
$ py.test test_github_client.py::test_func
# all http requests are handled by responses based on the existing
# cassette
```

## Customize the vts fixture
### Record or playback?
Out of the box [pytest-vts][] will switch itself into *recording* mode
each time a [cassette][] file is not found. This can be overriden by using
an environment variable `PYTEST_VTS_FORCE_RECORDING` which will allow
you to re-record an existing cassette

### Cassette location and name
When using the  of the vts fixture, if the
automatically determined location and the name for a [cassette][] are not
convenable you can customize them using [`pytest.mark.parametrize` mechanism][1].

  - [pytest's injection mode][]:
```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("vts", [{"basedir": "", "cassette_name": ""}], indirect=["vts"])
def test_list_repositories(vts):
    github_client.list_repositories()
    assert vts.calls
```

  - non-injection mode. If vts fixture handle is not needed inside the
test there is no need to declare it as an argument to a test
function. Use `pytest.mark.usefixtures` instead. As a bonus, this
allows to turn on the vts fixture only once for a collection of test
methods, grouped inside a class.

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.usefixtures("vts")
@pytest.mark.parametrize("vts", ["/store/cassette/here"], indirect=["vts"])
class TestMoreTests(object):
    def test_list_repositories_once(self):
        github_client.list_repositories()

    def test_list_repositories_twice(self):
        github_client.list_repositories()
```

### Strict comparison for playback mode
Strict mode specifies the precision of the comparison of the current
http request and the recorded request is made. By default responses
will compare the current http request against the recorded requests
using the url of the request only. Additionally, [pytest-vts][] optionally
adds more complexity to the comparison:
  - request's body (defaults to `False`)
  - request's headers (defaults to `False`)
  - request's query string (defaults to `False`)

Using the above [`pytest.mark.parametrize` mechanism][1] allows you to
configure multiple tests at various levels (module,class,function),
such as:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("vts", [{"play_kwargs": {"strict_body": True}}], indirect=["vts"])
class TestMoreTests(object):
    def test_list_repositories_once(self, vts):
        github_client.list_repositories()

    def test_list_repositories_twice(self, vts):
        github_client.list_repositories()
```

However if you desire to toggle strict comparison during a certain
unittest you can do that by using the `vts` instance.

```python
import pytest

class TestMoreTests(object):
    def test_list_repositories_once(self, vts):
        vts.strict_body = True
        github_client.list_repositories()
        vts.strict_body = False
        github_client.list_repositories()
        vts.strict_body = True
        github_client.list_repositories()

    def test_list_repositories_twice(self, vts):
        github_client.list_repositories()
```

# How does it actually work?
The vts fixture exposes an instance of a `vts.Recorder` class which
initialize it's own copy of `responses.RequestsMock` object. This is
to allow `vts` to manage its own `responses.start|stop|reset()` cycles
without interfering with the default `responses.RequestsMock` object
exposed by default by [responses][] through `response.*`
interface. This way you can continue using `import response;
response.start|add|add_callback|reset|stop` in parallel with
`vts`. However if you plan to do so remember there will be 2 instances
trying to `mock.patch()` [requests][] so be careful and `.stop()` one
before `start()` the other.  Obviously the last `.start`-ed one will
be active. For more details on this issue read [response][]'s source
and [unittest.mock][] docs.

Beside its own copy of `response.RequestsMock` vts is responsible of:

<a name="cassette">
  - building an internal copy of most information exposed by
    `responses` as a json copy. Similar with other recording libraries
    [pytest-vts][] refers to this as a **cassette**.
</a>
  - deciding the location of the cassette, based on the test module's
    location and the current test function/method name .
  - *record*ing a new cassette, or *play*ing an existing one.


# Why this and not other http mocking and recording library?
Because the current available options have some shortcommings which
**vts** tries to address, probably not without introducing some of
its own :) :

  - [betamax][], [vcr.py][], [httpretty][]: are all saving the
    gzipped/deflated responses verbatim which is
    [considerate](https://betamax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/implementation_details.html#gzip-content-encoding)
    but not very useful when visually inspecting the [cassette][]s.
  - [httpretty][]: recording/playback-ing feature is not mentioned in the
    docs which suggests an experimental status.
  - [betamax][]: while mocking only requests is not an issue, providing a
    handle to the session object might be inconvenient in
    some use cases
  - [mock][] or equivalents: are great for solitary tests, but
    requires extra plumbing code to setup the mocking for each tests

So far, [pytest-vts][] has been succesfully used to automate the
testing of an application which heavily relies on making HTTP requests
on upstream web based APIs.

# Why a pytest plugin and not standalone?
Because, among a lot of features, [pytest][] offers fixtures and tests
introspections out of the box, complemented by an awesome development
support (to name just a few: pytester builtin fixture,
pytest-localserver).

Test introspections have been very useful implementing convenience
features such as:

  - automatic naming of the [cassette][] files based on the test name
  - automatic deciding the location of the cassettes based on the
    tests modules
  - saving the cassette only if the test has passed

The above examples of how to customize the vts fixture are in fact
pytest's fixtures features.

# Why supporting [responses][] and not others?
Because I think its API is familiar and proved itself as a very
reliable option.

# Future features?
  1. implement various strategies of handling new/missing requests
  from cassette-recorded. Currently when a new request not recorded
  for a test happens the behaviour defined by the mocking library
  happens.  (e.g. [responses][] will raise a
  `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`)
  2. serialize requests' `response.history` to cassette json.
  3. support other http-mocking libraries (probably those with
     callbacks as mock responses? - most of them have that).
  4. add suppport for filtering sensitive information (e.g. passwords,
     auth headers) from cassettes in case they're publicly available
     (e.g. vcs stored on a public vcs service).
  5. add an information text about test being recorded/playbacked in
     the -vv output of pytest.
  6. consider having tracks saved in their own files to avoid having
     cassettes to big
  7. resolve potential conflicts in automatic naming of cassette (same
     test method in 2 different module in the same pacakge) files,
     maybe by using their module name as prefix?
  8. consider not saving duplicated tracks
  9. handle `tracks` with duplicated `['request']` but different
     `['response']`. Keep the first one? The last one? Raise? Keep?
     make use of [responses][]' `assert_all_requests_are_fired`? Keep
     all duplicates and support responses' functionality.
  10. have separate objects (sides?) for tracks recorded during tests
     vs recorded during fixture setup/teardown?
  11. [DONE] have playback callbacks raising when the body of the
      request doesn't match the body of the recorded request
  12. extend the above behaviour for headers/query_strings/selective
      headers?
  13. the body of the requests is string. Would be more practical to
      have if as dict.
  14. Improve the api interface to configure the vts fixture for a
      test (e.g. set always recording/playing, don't save cassette,
      etc)
  15. Currently having 2 tests with the same name in different classes
      will reuse the same cassette(use the full identifier for a
      test?)
  16. Command line to reply a cassette using curl/requests?
  17. It seems [cookies][] library used by [responses][] has problems
      parsing `set-cookie` headers with data format in them such as
      `"Expires=Fri, 24 Feb 2017 00:58:28 GMT"` and a fix to that
      library seems quite unlikely to happen since it looks pretty
      much like a dead library. Furthermore it seems [responses][]
      starts to be abandoned which may indicate it's stuck with
      cookeis for a while, so maybe implementing our own requests
      patching might not be the worst idea ever. Or maybe get involved
      in responses a bit more.
  18. Yet another problem with [responses][] is the way it matches the
      mocked requests. For requests with bodies (POST, PUT, PATCH) it
      doesn't consider the body when trying to match the current
      request => always the first url is matched. Consider vendoring a
      modified version of [responses][].

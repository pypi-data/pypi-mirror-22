Noisyopt is a library for local optimization of noisy objective functions.

Optimization in the presence of stochasticity in the objective function
evaluation is challenging. This library provides simple, robust algorithms
to solve this problem.

For more info see the `documentation <http://noisyopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ or the `source code <http://github.com/andim/noisyopt>`_.

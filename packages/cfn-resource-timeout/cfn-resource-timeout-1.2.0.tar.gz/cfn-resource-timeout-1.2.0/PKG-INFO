Description: ========================
        ``cfn-resource-timeout``
        ========================
        
        This project is a decorator and validation system that takes the
        drudgery out of writing custom resources. You still have access to the
        context and event as normal, but the decorator handles serializing your
        response and communicating results to CloudFormation.
        
        See `cfn-lambda <https://github.com/andrew-templeton/cfn-lambda>`__ from
        Andrew Templeton if you're looking to write your custom resources in
        Node.js.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        1. Copy ``cfn_resource.py`` into the directory of your lambda function
           ``handler.py``, which can be done by installing with ``pip``.
        2. Use the ``cfn_resource.Resource`` event decorators to decorate your
           handler like in ``example.py``
        3. Zip up the contents and upload to Lambda
        
        Once the function is up, copy its ARN and use it as the ServiceToken for
        your `custom
        resource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-cfn-customresource.html>`__.

        .. code-block:: json
        
            {
                "AWSTemplateFormatVersion": "2010-09-09",
                "Resources": {
                    "FakeThing": {
                        "Type": "Custom::MyResource",
                        "Properties": {
                            "ServiceToken": "arn:aws:lambda:SOME-REGION:ACCOUNT:function:FunctionName",
                            "OtherThing": "foobar",
                            "AnotherThing": 2
                        }
                    }
                }
            }

        docs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-custom-resources.html>`__
        
        Code Sample
        -----------
        
        For this example, you need to have your handler in Lambda set as
        ``filename.handler`` where filename has the below contents.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import cfn_resource
        
            # set `handler` as the entry point for Lambda
            handler = cfn_resource.Resource()
        
            @handler.create
            def create_thing(event, context):
                # do some stuff
                return {"PhysicalResourceId": "arn:aws:fake:myID"}
        
            @handler.update
            def update_thing(event, context):
                # do some stuff
                return {"PhysicalResourceId": "arn:aws:fake:myID"}
        
            @handler.delete
            def delete_thing(event, context):
                # do some stuff
                return {"PhysicalResourceId": "arn:aws:fake:myID"}
        
        Running Tests
        -------------
        
        Install and run `tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_:
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
            tox
        
        The tests use ``mock`` and ``pytest`` and will give you a terminal
        coverage report. Currently the tests cover ~90% of the (very small)
        codebase.

        Pending Release
        ---------------
        
        * (Insert new release notes below this line)
        
        1.2.0 (2017-05-03)
        ------------------
        
        * Move from ``urllib`` to ``requests`` to fix some encoding errors on Python 3
        
        1.1.0 (2017-04-27)
        ------------------
        
        * Added Python 3 compatibility
        
        1.0.0 (2017-03-22)
        ------------------
        
        * Forked from RyanSB to Time Out.
        * Allow rescheduling - by raising the new built-in ``NoResponse`` exception, a
          resource can avoid sending any messing to CloudFormation. This is to support
          Lambda functions that take >300 seconds to execute and thus reschedule
          themselves.
        
        0.2.2 (2016-01-29)
        ------------------
        
        * Last version `by RyanSB <https://github.com/ryansb/cfn-wrapper-python>`_.

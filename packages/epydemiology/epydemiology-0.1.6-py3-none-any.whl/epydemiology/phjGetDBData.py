"""
There appears to be a problem with the pypyodbc library that causes column names
to be returned as the first letter only as a byte rather than a char.
This question was asked on StackExchange (Dec 2015) and is seems that the
problem had already been reported to pypyodbc in 2014. No update has since been
released to fix the problem.

Therefore, will connect using pymssql or pymysql instead...

N.B. There is an obscure bug on Unix machines (see: http://www.pymssql.org/en/latest/freetds_and_dates.html)
where returned dates can be shifted back by one month. I checked the results returned below with the
dates in the database and this problem does not seem to be an issue.

# IMPORT REQUIRED PACKAGES
# ========================
# The following method to check that a package is available is not considered to be
# good practice:
#
#	try:
#		import package_name
#		HAVE_PACKAGE = True
#	except ImportError:
#		HAVE_PACKAGE = False
#
# Instead use the following method (as described at: https://docs.plone.org/develop/styleguide/python.html#about-imports)...

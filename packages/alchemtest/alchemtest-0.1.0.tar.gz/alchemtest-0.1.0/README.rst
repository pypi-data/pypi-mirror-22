alchemtest: the simple alchemistry test set
===========================================

**Warning**: This library is young. It is **not** API stable. It is a
nucleation point. By all means use and help improve it, but note that it will
change with time.

**alchemtest**  is a collection of test datasets for alchemical free energy calculations.
The datasets come from a variety of software packages, primarily molecular
dynamics engines, and are used as the test set for `alchemlyb`_.
The package is standalone, however, and can be used for any purpose.

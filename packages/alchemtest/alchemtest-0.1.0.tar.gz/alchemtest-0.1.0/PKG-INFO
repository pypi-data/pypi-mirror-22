        ===========================================
        
        **Warning**: This library is young. It is **not** API stable. It is a
        nucleation point. By all means use and help improve it, but note that it will
        change with time.
        
        **alchemtest**  is a collection of test datasets for alchemical free energy calculations.
        The datasets come from a variety of software packages, primarily molecular
        dynamics engines, and are used as the test set for `alchemlyb`_.
        The package is standalone, however, and can be used for any purpose.

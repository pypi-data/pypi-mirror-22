Description: ActionML Python SDK
                               ActionML is a prediction server for building smart
                               applications. While you search data through a database
                               server, you can make prediction through ActionML.
                               With ActionML, you can write apps
                               - that predict user behaviors based on solid data
                                 science
                               - using your choice of state-of-the-art machine
                                 learning algorithms
                               - without worrying about scalability
                               Detailed documentation is available on our
                               `documentation site <a href="http://actionml.com/docs">docs</a>`.
                               This module provides convenient access of the
                               ActionML API to Python programmers so that they
                               can focus on their application logic.

    The auth service, typically available at `auth.taskcluster.net`
    is responsible for storing credentials, managing assignment of scopes,
    and validation of request signatures from other services.

    These exchanges provides notifications when credentials or roles are
    updated. This is mostly so that multiple instances of the auth service
    can purge their caches and synchronize state. But you are of course
    welcome to use these for other purposes, monitoring changes for example.

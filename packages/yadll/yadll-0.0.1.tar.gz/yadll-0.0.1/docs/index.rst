Welcome to Yadll
================

**Y**\ et **a**\ nother **d**\ eep **l**\ earning **l**\ ab.

This is an ultra light deep learning framework written in Python and based on Theano_.
It allows you to very quickly start building Deep Learning models and play with toy examples.

If you are looking for mature deep learning APIs I would recommend Lasagne_, keras_ or blocks_ instead of yadll, they are well documented and contributed projects.

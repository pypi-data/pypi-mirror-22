This is a collection of objects and patterns for working with processes in Python using the multiprocessing library.

The main idea is that you express your unit of work as a simple method on an object and then when that object is
instantiated the work will be run in a subprocess.


Use cases
---------

Offspring was built to address the following use cases for running code in a subprocess.


Run something once
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

	from offspring import Subprocess


	class MyTask(Subprocess):
		def __init__(self, arg1):
			# this is run in the parent process and is used to prepare your object
			self.arg = arg

		def run(self):
			# this will be run in the child process and completes your work
			# ...


	MyTask('this is arg1').wait()


Run in a loop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

	from offspring import SubprocessLoop


	class MyTask(SubprocessLoop):
		def __init__(self, arg1):
			# this is run in the parent process and is used to prepare your object
			self.arg = arg

		def begin(self):
			# called at the start of the loop in your child process

		def loop(self):
			# called each loop iteration in your your child process
			# it should return a sleep duration until the next loop, or False to stop the loop

		def end(self):
			# called at the end of the loop in your child process


	MyTask('this is arg1').wait()


Implementation details
----------------------

``.process``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each ``Subprocess`` object has a ``.process`` attribute that is the ``multiprocessing.Process`` object.


``.wait``
~~~~~~~~~

If you need to wait for your child process you can call ``.wait`` on your ``Subprocess`` object.


``WAIT_FOR_CHILD``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If set to ``True`` on your ``Subprocess`` class then a ``Pipe`` will be used to block the parent process until the child
has started.  This is useful when you want to ensure that your ``Subprocess`` object is started and ``.run`` is called
even if the parent process exits quickly.

.. code-block:: python

	class MyTask(Subprocess):
		WAIT_FOR_CHILD = True

		def run(self):
			print("This will always print")

	MyTask().wait()

The ``SubprocessLoop`` class does this to ensure that your object has ``begin`` & ``end`` called (``loop`` may not be
called as a TERM signal received during startup will prevent the loop from every actually completing other than
``begin`` & ``end``).


``TERMINATE_ON_SHUTDOWN``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If set to ``False`` then when ``.shutdown`` is called on a ``Subprocess`` object the child process **will not** be
terminated before being joined.  This means that the parent will block until the child completes the ``.run`` function.

.. code-block:: python

	import time

	class MyTask(Subprocess):
		TERMINATE_ON_SHUTDOWN = False

		def run(self):
			time.sleep(2)

	# Note that we do not call .wait on the task here since we will automatically wait for the child
	MyTask()

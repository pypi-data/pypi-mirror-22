A Jupyter kernel for Kdb/q
==========================

No other dependencies beides Jupyter and Q. Easy setup.

It is probably very rough around the edges, but seems to work. Please
report any issues you end up having.

**Other Existing Kernels**

-  `IKdbQ <https://github.com/jvictorchen/IKdbQ>`__

Todo
====

-  [STRIKEOUT:Multiline support] Should be done now
-  Image support?
-  Code cleanup
-  Implementing code completion.
-  Testing (I doubt k support currently works)
-  [STRIKEOUT:Pip/Conda publication]

Install
=======

This requires IPython 3. Note that ``q`` must be in your path and
``$QHOME`` must be correctly defined.

::

    pip install kdbq_kernel
    python -m kdbq_kernel.install

To make sure it is installed:

::

    jupyter kernelspec list

To use it, run one of:

::

    jupyter notebook
    # In the notebook interface, select Kdb/Q from the 'New' menu
    jupyter qtconsole --kernel kdbq
    jupyter console --kernel kdbq

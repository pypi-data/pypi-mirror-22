        Code School LMS is a Django-based learning environment for programming. The most
        basic functionality is a system for automatic grading of I/O based programming
        questions.
        
        In the future, we expect to support most features that a standard learning
        environment supports like classroom management, discussion forums, quizzes, etc.

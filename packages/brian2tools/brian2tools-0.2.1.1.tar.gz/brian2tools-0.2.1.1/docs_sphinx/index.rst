brian2tools documentation
=========================

The `brian2tools` package is a collection of useful tools for
the `Brian 2 simulator <https://brian2.readthedocs.org>`_. The project
is still in its infancy but it already provides helpful functions
for plotting and exporting a neural model to the
`NeuroML2 format <https://neuroml.org/neuromlv2>`_. In the future it will be
extended to also provide analysis and additional export/import functions.

Description: Psycopg2 Range Overlaps
        ========================
        
        This module overrides the Range.__and__ function, so that it returns a boolean value
        based on if the two objects overlap.
        
        The rationale behind this is that it mirrors the `range && range` operator in postgres.
        
        
        There is also an improved equality operator, and a function for normalising ranges (if possible).

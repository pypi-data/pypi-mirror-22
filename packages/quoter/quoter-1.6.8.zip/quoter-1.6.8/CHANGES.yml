        Minor fix to Markdown module. Turns out HTML stops at ``h6``,

    version: 1.6.4
    date: September 7, 2015
    notes: >
        Quoters can now take a variable number of arguments. A ``sep``
        kwarg determins how multiple pieces are combined. Defaults to
        empty string, so rank concatenation. Full rationalization re
        ``Joiner`` awaits another day.
        
        Minor testing cleanups.

    version: 1.6.3

    notes: >
        Handful of minor cleanups.
        
        All previously skipped tests are now re-enabled and passing.
        
        Argument handling of ``Quoter`` creation is now hardened. If a
        prefix or suffix is explicitly set but not the other, the unset one
        defaults to an empty string, not to the other one that is set.
        
        The ``pair`` keyword for compact setting of balanced quote
        prefix/suffix pairs is returned to service (in earlier
        incarndations, this was the ``chars`` kwarg).
        
        Extended documentation. Added API Reference.

    version: 1.6.0
    date: September 7, 2015
    notes: >
        Major redesign of the named styles facility. Refactored style
        management out of ``Quoter`` and its subclasses and into
        separate ``StyleSet`` class.  Much cleaner and more reliable.
        
        The ``style=`` kwarg to ``Quoter`` classes, however, goes away.
        It was "a bridge too
        far," complicating everything and not adding real value.
        Its function is now found in ``StyleSet._define()``. 
        
        While this is largely an "infrastructure" rather than functional
        release, there were some minor functional improvements:
        Markdown quoting extended with ``hr`` and ``h1`` through ``h7``
        header methods. XML quoting now has ``cdata`` and ``pcdata`` methods.
        Both of these are part of an incremental march toward functional
        completeness in their respective quoting realms.
        
        Withdrew branch coverage testing metric. While a good idea in theory,
        current tools do not provide sufficient actionable intelligence to
        directly identify source of branch misses.

    version: 1.5.5
    date: August 24, 2015
    notes: >
        Start of a Markdown capability. It is at a experimental, proof of
        concept, or demonstration stage rather than production-use stage at
        present--much as HTML and XML quoting functions were a few releases
        back. The initial goal is to stretch the ``quoter`` use-case and
        prove/harden its extension mechanisms. Even at its inaugural stage,
        it is doing just that.

    version: 1.5.0
    date: August 20, 2015
    notes: >
        Enables cloning and specialization of all ``Quoter`` subclasses,
        including ``xml`` and ``html`` objects docs previously warned were
        non-functional. Refactors majority of ``Joiner`` functionality as a
        subclass of ``Quoter``, with all the rights and privileges thereunto
        appertaining.
    
        Extends tests.

    version: 1.4.4
    date: August 20, 2015
    notes: >
        Added "naked" invocations of primary quoter front-ends,
        such as ``html("joe", "b.one")``.
        This allows quoters to take on primary information (such
        as the tag name) during each call.  This was long planned
        for the API, but had been sidelined due to now-quashed
        complexity.
        
- 
    version: 1.4.3
    date: August 20, 2015
    notes: >
        Added ``but`` synonym for ``clone`` to have simpler,

    version: 1.4.0
    date: August 20, 2015
    notes: >
        Major rewrite of complex argument handling for XMLQuoter (and
        HTMLQuoter subclass). Should be much more robust and extensible.
        Refactored some functions into ``util.py``
      
        Adds direct attribute setting ``[key=value]`` to the
        CSS selector specification language.

        Improved testing. Added new tests of sub-cases of parsing the
        arguments. Updated strategy to have quicker basic tests with
        ``sudo tox``, but easy full coverage analysis with 
        ``sudo tox -c toxcov.ini``. Advances test line coverage
        to 100%.

        Initiated external CI with Travis.
        Dropped Python 2.6 from official support given issues getting
        it running on Travis (though it actually does work).

    version: 1.3.0
    date: August 11, 2015
    notes: >
        First release of integrated sequence joining.
        ``join``, ``word_join``, ``and_join``, ``or_join``, ``joinlines``, and
        ``items`` are functional and tested, but still less mature than the
        rest of the codebase.
        
-
    version: 1.2.0
    date: August 11, 2015
    notes: >
        Institutes full named styles within each quoting class.
        Tests and docs tweaked. Embedded ``nulltype`` module
        withdrawn in favor of full ``nulltype`` imported by ``options``.

    date: August 3, 2015
    notes: >
        Cleans up HTML quoting, esp. re void / self-closing elements.
        Adds new double-backtick functions. Changed to Apache License 2.0.
        Updates docs and testing matrix.

-
    version: 1.0.3
    date: November 1, 2013
    notes: >
        HTML, XML, and lambda quoters now use class-relative styles
        dictionaries, as opposed to piggybacking the standard Quoter styles
        dictionary.
        
        Improved docs and tests.
        
        Added ``lambdaq`` front-end parallel to ``quote``, ``html``, and
        ``xml``.

    version: 1.0.2

        Some internal cleanups to improve code reuse among classes. Bumped
        from Alpha to Beta status.

-
    version: 1.0.1
    date: October 31, 2013
    notes: >
        A new alternate API consisting of attribute names off of a default
        quoting object (e.g. ``quote.single`` as a specialization of
        ``quote``) has been instituted. This is mostly, but not perfectly, a
        superset of the previous use of a ``quote()`` function.
        
        The naming infrastructure has been beefed up, with multiple names
        (aliases) possible for all named objects.
        
        A new ``XMLQuoter`` is inserted as a superclass of ``HTMLQuoter`. It
        has ``HTMLQuoter``'s ability to parse CSS style id and class name
        definitions (e.g. ``'#first.big.special'``), as well as namespace
        support (new ``ns`` attribute).
        
        XML and HTML quoters for individual tags are automagically generated
        upon first use. E.g. ``html.b('this')`` creates an
        ``HTMLQuoter(tag='b', name='b')`` quoter that is cached as
        ``html.b`` for subsequent uses.
        
        Updated versioning strategy to comply with `PEP 386
        <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0386/>`_
        
        Various other structural and packaging cleanups. E.g. moved into
        proper Python package; given introspectable version number; removed
        old ``verno`` auto-update of version number; this proper change long
        instituted; etc.

    version: 0.308
    date: October 30, 2012
    notes: >
        Last version before PEP 386 versioning switch. Upgrade away from
        these old versions if for no other reason than improving the
        auto-install logic.

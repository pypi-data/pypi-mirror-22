Change Log
==========

**1.6.7**  (February 20, 2017)

    Updated testing matrix. Now certified under Python 3.6 and latest
    versions of PyPy and PyPy3.


**1.6.6**  (September 16, 2015)

    Updated testing for Python 3.5.0 final and PyPy 2.6.1  (based on
    CPython 2.7.10).


**1.6.5**  (September 8, 2015)

    Minor fix to Markdown module. Turns out HTML stops at ``h6``, not
    ``h7``.  Oops!


**1.6.4**  (September 7, 2015)

    Quoters can now take a variable number of arguments. A ``sep``
    kwarg determins how multiple pieces are combined. Defaults to
    empty string, so rank concatenation. Full rationalization re
    ``Joiner`` awaits another day.

    Minor testing cleanups.


**1.6.3**  (September 7, 2015)

    Handful of minor cleanups.

    All previously skipped tests are now re-enabled and passing.

    Argument handling of ``Quoter`` creation is now hardened. If a
    prefix or suffix is explicitly set but not the other, the unset
    one defaults to an empty string, not to the other one that is set.

    The ``pair`` keyword for compact setting of balanced quote
    prefix/suffix pairs is returned to service (in earlier
    incarndations, this was the ``chars`` kwarg).

    Extended documentation. Added API Reference.


**1.6.0**  (September 7, 2015)

    Major redesign of the named styles facility. Refactored style
    management out of ``Quoter`` and its subclasses and into separate
    ``StyleSet`` class.  Much cleaner and more reliable.

    The ``style=`` kwarg to ``Quoter`` classes, however, goes away. It
    was "a bridge too far," complicating everything and not adding
    real value. Its function is now found in ``StyleSet._define()``.

    While this is largely an "infrastructure" rather than functional
    release, there were some minor functional improvements: Markdown
    quoting extended with ``hr`` and ``h1`` through ``h7`` header
    methods. XML quoting now has ``cdata`` and ``pcdata`` methods.
    Both of these are part of an incremental march toward functional
    completeness in their respective quoting realms.

    Withdrew branch coverage testing metric. While a good idea in
    theory, current tools do not provide sufficient actionable
    intelligence to directly identify source of branch misses.


**1.5.6**  (August 22, 2015)

    Extended Markdown feature with header function ``h``


**1.5.5**  (August 24, 2015)

    Start of a Markdown capability. It is at a experimental, proof of
    concept, or demonstration stage rather than production-use stage
    at present--much as HTML and XML quoting functions were a few
    releases back. The initial goal is to stretch the ``quoter`` use-
    case and prove/harden its extension mechanisms. Even at its
    inaugural stage, it is doing just that.


**1.5.3**  (August 23, 2015)

    Reorg of XML and HTML code into own module. Parallel reorg of
    tests. All tests passing.


**1.5.2**  (August 23, 2015)

    Starts automatic collection of test branch coverage. Begins with
    99% coverage.


**1.5.0**  (August 20, 2015)

    Enables cloning and specialization of all ``Quoter`` subclasses,
    including ``xml`` and ``html`` objects docs previously warned were
    non-functional. Refactors majority of ``Joiner`` functionality as
    a subclass of ``Quoter``, with all the rights and privileges
    thereunto appertaining.

    Extends tests.


**1.4.4**  (August 20, 2015)

    Added "naked" invocations of primary quoter front-ends, such as
    ``html("joe", "b.one")``. This allows quoters to take on primary
    information (such as the tag name) during each call.  This was
    long planned for the API, but had been sidelined due to now-
    quashed complexity.


**1.4.3**  (August 20, 2015)

    Added ``but`` synonym for ``clone`` to have simpler, clearer
    invocations.


**1.4.2**  (August 20, 2015)

    Docs were getting long. Truncated ``README.rst`` and converted
    majority to Sphinx docs to be hosted on readthedocs.


**1.4.1**  (August 20, 2015)

    Documentation fix.


**1.4.0**  (August 20, 2015)

    Major rewrite of complex argument handling for XMLQuoter (and
    HTMLQuoter subclass). Should be much more robust and extensible.
    Refactored some functions into ``util.py``

    Adds direct attribute setting ``[key=value]`` to the CSS selector
    specification language.

    Improved testing. Added new tests of sub-cases of parsing the
    arguments. Updated strategy to have quicker basic tests with
    ``sudo tox``, but easy full coverage analysis with  ``sudo tox -c
    toxcov.ini``. Advances test line coverage to 100%.


**1.3.6**  (August 17, 2015)

    Updated testing strategy with integrated multi-version coverage
    testing. Achieved 98%.


**1.3.5**  (August 14, 2015)

    Fixed RST problem in docs


**1.3.4**  (August 14, 2015)

    Added Travis CI badge and note about 2.6 release to docs


**1.3.3**  (August 11, 2015)

    Some code reorganization and updating of common string routines.


**1.3.2**  (August 11, 2015)

    Initiated external CI with Travis. Dropped Python 2.6 from
    official support given issues getting it running on Travis (though
    it actually does work).


**1.3.0**  (August 11, 2015)

    First release of integrated sequence joining. ``join``,
    ``word_join``, ``and_join``, ``or_join``, ``joinlines``, and
    ``items`` are functional and tested, but still less mature than
    the rest of the codebase.


**1.2.0**  (August 11, 2015)

    Institutes full named styles within each quoting class. Tests and
    docs tweaked. Embedded ``nulltype`` module withdrawn in favor of
    full ``nulltype`` imported by ``options``.


**1.1.4**  (August 3, 2015)

    Experimental switch to YAML format for change log. Some setup,
    testing, and config updates.


**1.1.3**  (August 3, 2015)

    Cloning and changing of ``Quoter`` instances (though not yet
    ``HTMLQuoter`` or ``XMLQuoter`` instances) is now operational.


**1.1.0**  (August 3, 2015)

    Cleans up HTML quoting, esp. re void / self-closing elements. Adds
    new double-backtick functions. Changed to Apache License 2.0.
    Updates docs and testing matrix.


**1.0.3**  (November 1, 2013)

    HTML, XML, and lambda quoters now use class-relative styles
    dictionaries, as opposed to piggybacking the standard Quoter
    styles dictionary.

    Improved docs and tests.

    Added ``lambdaq`` front-end parallel to ``quote``, ``html``, and
    ``xml``.


**1.0.2**  (October 31, 2013)

    Some internal cleanups to improve code reuse among classes. Bumped
    from Alpha to Beta status.


**1.0.1**  (October 31, 2013)

    A new alternate API consisting of attribute names off of a default
    quoting object (e.g. ``quote.single`` as a specialization of
    ``quote``) has been instituted. This is mostly, but not perfectly,
    a superset of the previous use of a ``quote()`` function.

    The naming infrastructure has been beefed up, with multiple names
    (aliases) possible for all named objects.

    A new ``XMLQuoter`` is inserted as a superclass of ``HTMLQuoter`.
    It has ``HTMLQuoter``'s ability to parse CSS style id and class
    name definitions (e.g. ``'#first.big.special'``), as well as
    namespace support (new ``ns`` attribute).

    XML and HTML quoters for individual tags are automagically
    generated upon first use. E.g. ``html.b('this')`` creates an
    ``HTMLQuoter(tag='b', name='b')`` quoter that is cached as
    ``html.b`` for subsequent uses.

    Updated versioning strategy to comply with `PEP 386
    <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0386/>`_

    Various other structural and packaging cleanups. E.g. moved into
    proper Python package; given introspectable version number;
    removed old ``verno`` auto-update of version number; this proper
    change long instituted; etc.


**0.308**  (October 30, 2012)

    Last version before PEP 386 versioning switch. Upgrade away from
    these old versions if for no other reason than improving the auto-
    install logic.

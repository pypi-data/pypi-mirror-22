        ========
        
        A proper description will follow.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install the Hydrobox using pip. At the current stage, this package is
        not jet hosted on PyPI, due to the alpha state. Therefore it has to be
        downloaded from git and install locally. Once it is in alpha state, it
        will be available on PyPI.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            git clone https://git.scc.kit.edu/aw6481/hydrobox.git
            cd hydrobox
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            pip install -e .
        
        Tests
        -----
        
        The hydrobox module uses unittest for setting up some test. The test
        routines are not yet added to setuptools. There are only some isolated
        TestCases so far. Once a full featured TestSuite is created, this will
        be passed to setuptools.
        Nevertheless, any of the test scripts can be run. To test the accept
        decorator from the util.decorators submodule run:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            python /path/to/hydrobox/tests/decorators.py 
        
            ...
            Ran 5 tests in 0.081s
        
            OK
        
        
        Alternatively, nose is integrated to run either nosetests in the repository root
        or run it from the setup.py like:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            python setup.py test
        
            ...
            ----------------------------------------------------------------------
            Ran 10 tests in 1.792s
        
            OK

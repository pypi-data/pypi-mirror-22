        MacOS OpenDirectory Authorization Middleware for Flask
        
        This package is tailored to my use-case, where my Authentication is from
        MacOS Server, which authenticates a user, however I need to have specific 
        Flask routes, that only allow users of certain OpenDirectory groups.  
        
        So that's why I call this an Authorization Middleware, however it could be a
        base for someone who would like to implement a full authorization layer.
        
        This package utilizes an ``LDAP`` connection to query the ``OpenDirectory``, it
        is setup to only do ``read`` operations with the connection.

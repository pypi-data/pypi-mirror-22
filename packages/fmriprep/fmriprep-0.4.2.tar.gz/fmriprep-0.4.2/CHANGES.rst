* [ENH] Switch bbregister init from ``fsl`` to ``coreg`` (FreeSurfer native #423)
* [ENH] Motion estimation now uses a smart reference image that takes advantage of T1 saturation (#421)
* [FIX] Fix report generation with ``--reports-only`` (#427)

0.3.1 (24th of March 2017)
==========================

* [ENH] Added preliminary support for reconstruction of cortical surfaces using FreeSurfer
* [ENH] Switched to bbregister for BOLD to T1 coregistration
* [ENH] Switched to sinc interpolation of preprocessed BOLD and T1w outputs
* [ENH] Preprocessed BOLD volumes are now saved in the T1w space instead of mean BOLD
* [FIX] Fixed a bug with MCFLIRT interpolation inducing slow drift
* [ENH] All files are now saved in Float32 instead of Float64 to save space

0.2.0 (13th of January 2017)
============================

Provides a simple web service interface to a Certificate Authority.  This is
suitable for use as a SLCS (Short-Lived Credential Service).

The interface is implemented as a WSGI application which fronts a Certificate
Authority.  The Certificate Authority is implemented with the ``ContrailCA``
package also available from PyPI.

Web service call can be made to request an X.509 certificate.  The web service
interface is RESTful and uses GET and POST operations.  The service should be
hosted over HTTPS.  Client authentication is configurable to the required means
using any WSGI-compatible filters including repoze.who.  An application is
included which  uses HTTP Basic Auth to pass username/password credentials.
SSL client-based authentication can also be used.  A client is available with
the ``ContrailOnlineCAClient`` package also available from PyPI.

The code has been developed for the Contrail Project, http://contrail-project.eu/

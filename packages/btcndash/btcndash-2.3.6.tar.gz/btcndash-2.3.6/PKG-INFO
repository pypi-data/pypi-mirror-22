Description: ========
        BTCnDash
        ========
        
        BTCnDash is a web-based dashboard displaying information about the status of a bitcoin node such
        as currently connected peers, recent transactions forwarded, bandwidth usage, and network stats
        like hash rate. Most items are generated automatically or retrieved from the bitcoind server
        itself via RPC calls.
        
        BTCnDash is meant to be lightweight, and with the assumption that there will be very low traffic
        to the dashboard. As such, it does not use a full webserver like Nginx or apache. It uses the
        Bottle_ microframework and generates static status pages on a schedule. Python's WSGI reference
        server is used as the actual webserver, but Bottle (and therefore BTCnDash) can be served by lots
        of different servers. You could also simply serve the statics pages only.
        
        Python 2.7 is required. Python 3.5 works, but is not as well tested! Bitcoin Core v0.12 through
        v0.14 appear to work, but the latest v0.14 has not been thoroughly tested.

BTCnDash
========

BTCnDash is a web-based dashboard displaying information about the status of a bitcoin node such
as currently connected peers, recent transactions forwarded, bandwidth usage, and network stats
like hash rate. Most items are generated automatically or retrieved from the bitcoind server
itself via RPC calls.

BTCnDash is meant to be lightweight, and with the assumption that there will be very low traffic
to the dashboard. As such, it does not use a full webserver like Nginx or apache. It uses the
Bottle_ microframework and generates static status pages on a schedule. Python's WSGI reference
server is used as the actual webserver, but Bottle (and therefore BTCnDash) can be served by lots
of different servers. You could also simply serve the statics pages only.

Python 2.7 is required. Python 3.5 works, but is not as well tested! Bitcoin Core v0.12 through
v0.14 appear to work, but the latest v0.14 has not been thoroughly tested.

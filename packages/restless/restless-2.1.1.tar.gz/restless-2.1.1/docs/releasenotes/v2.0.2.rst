restless v2.0.2
===============

:date: 2016-11-14

This release makes some long-needed changes on error handling for ``Resource``
and its subclasses, plus support for both Django >= 1.9 and Tornado >= 4.0 and
allowing alphanumeric PKs on all supported frameworks.


Features

* Allowed PKs with dashes and alphanumeric digits. (SHA: e52333b)

  returning an ``HttpResponse`` from Django. (SHA: 27859c8)
* Added several ``HttpError`` subclasses. (SHA: e2aff93)

  ``__getattr__``. (SHA: 665ef31)

Description: Kanji\_to\_Romaji
        =================
        
        | Formerly kana\_to\_romaji
        | *Tries* to translate Kanji to Romaji with the help of `JMdict`_
        | Some typograhic characters are also translated since one of the
          original goals was to make the string printable in ascii
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        | ``pip install kanji_to_romaji``
        | or if pip is not available:
        | ``git clone https://github.com/rcamba/kanji_to_romaji``
        | ``install.bat``
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ``ktr.py`` is a script included to be used in the command line provided
        you have your python’s script folder in your environment variables
        
        | > ktr.py 友達に会いました
        | tomodachi ni aimashita
        
        | Although Windows cmd doesn’t seem to natively support unicode
          characters so you can use unicode escaped strings if you’d like…
        | > ktr.py \\u53cb\\u9054\\u306b\\u4f1a\\u3044\\u307e\\u3057\\u305f
        | tomodachi ni aimashita
        
        The more common usage will probably to be used in another program:
        
        ::
        
            from kanji_to_romaji import kanji_to_romaji
            print kanji_to_romaji(u"友達に会いました")
        
        Argument must be in unicode
        
        More examples
        -------------
        
        | 私は嬉: watashi wa ureshii
        | 更に向こうへ: sarani mukou e
        | 友達に会いました: tomodachi ni aimashita
        | 車には一人分の空きがあった: kuruma ni wa hitoribun no aki ga atta
        | bl∞dy☆: bl dy
        | 乷: \\u4e77 (not in Kanji unicode range)
        
        | See ``tests\test_kanji.py`` for more examples
        | **Note**: The particles は (ha/wa) or へ (he/e) won’t always be
          translated properly. Same goes for some of the Kanji translations
          since there are multiple possible readings for some of them depending
          on the context.

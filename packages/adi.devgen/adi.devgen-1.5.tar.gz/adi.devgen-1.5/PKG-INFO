Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Yet another command-line Plone-Add-On-Generator.
        
        This package doesn't have any dependencies, so all ever possible occuring
        problems can safely be attributed to itself.
        
        Additionally it was desirable to be able to execute any Plone-addon-extending
        command of within any location of an addon. Or, of outside of an addon, by
        prepending the path to the addon to the command, so one doesn't necessarily
        need to change directories and executing a command doesn't require you to be in
        a certain directory.
        
        Besides of Plone-addon-related helper-functions, there are also functions more
        general related to developing, like `doOnRemote()`, `getRepos()`, 
        `squash()`, and so on.
        
        Setting up a new Plone-instance is as easy as `addPlone()`, will download the
        configs for buildout locally and set buildout's mode to 'offline', so we save
        time, whenever running buildout, because it will not look up the configs of
        remote addresses, like usually, as time is honey.
        
        DISCLAIMER: The usual formatting of Plone-configs have changed, addPlone() works
        testedly up to Plone vs. 4.3.4, needs to be fixed for getting newer versions.
        
        
        Installation
        =============
        
        Stable-version
        --------------
        
        Of the commandline execute::
        
            pip install adi.devgen
        
        
        Develop-version
        ---------------
        
        Of the commandline execute::
        
            pip install -e git+https://github.com/ida/adi.devgen.git#egg=adi.devgen
        
        
        The latest state of this package will be added to a directory (a.k.a. folder)
        called 'src', which lives, where your pip lives. To find out where your pip
        lives, type `which pip` into your console. You can then change the code inside
        of the src-directory and get the effects immediately.
        
        
        
        Configuration / Presettings
        ===========================
        
        When creating a new addon and a file '~/.buildout/devgen.cfg' is present,
        values will be read of it and inserted into the `setup.py` of the addon.
        The file-contents' format must be like this::
        
        author=Arbi Trary
        
        author_email=arbi@tra.ry
        
        url=https://github.com/arbitrary/your.addon
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Type the command  and 'help', to get a verbose description fo this tool::
        
            devgen help
        
        Type the command alone, to get a list of the available generator-functions::
        
            devgen
        
        Or, have a look into the methods of adi.devgen.scripts.skel.addSkel, all of
        those are available of the commandline, when prepending 'devgen'.
        
        
        To get a choosen function's help-text, to see what arguments it expects, type::
        
            devgen [FUNCTION_NAME] help
        
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        Create boilerplate for an addon, that can do nothing, but be installed in a Plonesite::
        
            devgen addProfile your.addon
        
        
        Create it not in the directory, where you are, but somewhere else::
        
            devgen addProfile some/where/else/your.addon
        
        
        Register another addon as a dependency to your addon::
        
            devgen addDep collective.bestaddonever some/where/your.addon
        
        Or, first locate into your addon, then you can omit the appended path::
        
            cd your.addon
            devgen addDep collective.bestaddonever
        
        By the way, most commands work of within any location inside of an addon
        and no need to pass a path.
        
        Register and add a browser-based stylesheet named 'main.css' in
        'your.addon/your/addon/browser/resources'::
        
            devgen addCss
        
        Register and add a browser-based Javascript named 'magic.js' in
        'your.addon/your/addon/browser/resources'::
        
            devgen addJS magic
        
        Register and add a browser-based Template named 'main.pt' and a
        Python-script named 'main.py' with an example how to retrieve a
        computed value of the script in the template via TAL, in:
        'your.addon/your/addon/browser/resources'::
        
            devgen addView
        
        The view can then be called in a browser like this::
        
            http://localhost:8080/Plone/++resource++your.addon.resources/your_addon_main_view
        
        Where 'main' is the default name for the files, you can choose any other::
        
            devgen addView any_other
        
        That'll result to::
        
            http://localhost:8080/Plone/++resource++your.addon.resources/your_addon_any_other_view
        
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        - Regard more than one-dotted-namespace for addon.
        
        - Possibly transfer:

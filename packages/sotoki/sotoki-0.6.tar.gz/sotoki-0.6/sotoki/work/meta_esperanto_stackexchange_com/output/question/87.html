Should not those questions use a more specific tag, or (eventually) <a href="http://esperanto.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/grammaticality" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'grammaticality'" rel="tag">grammaticality</a>?</p>

<p>It seems to me that <a href="http://esperanto.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/grammar" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'grammar'" rel="tag">grammar</a> is used when users don't know which specific tag to use, or when asking about the grammaticality of a phrase. In the first case, the more specific tag should be used; in the second case, <a href="http://esperanto.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/grammaticality" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'grammaticality'" rel="tag">grammaticality</a> <em>should be</em> more appropriate.</p>

No, if you are asking about the grammaticality of a phrase, you aren't asking about grammar. 90% of the questions would be about grammar (e.g. verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions). Take off the questions about the history of a language, the etymology of a word, useful online resources, and you will see how many questions are about grammar.

            <span class="text">@NeilRoberts I was not referring to [tag:grammar], so I stand correct: Every tag that applies to 90% of the questions is pretty useless. I was replying to <em>a lot time, a question is specifically about grammar</em>.

<li>The word itself is not clear/common, so it may be misused. (I learned it today)</li>
<li>It is too broad.

<li>It is too common. It is extra work for users to add it to all questions about grammaticality.</li>
<li>I don't think it is helpful. Who would browse this tag? Esperanto is not a language with random grammatical exceptions. Every question about grammaticality can be divided in several questions about specific elements of the language.</li>

<p>If you fear people won't make a question because of the necessity of a tag, there are already other tags that are easy to understand and that adds relevant information. There is one for each kind of word, for example: <a href="http://esperanto.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/adverbs" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'adverbs'" rel="tag">adverbs</a> for question involving an adverb (general rules, request, meaning ...).</p>

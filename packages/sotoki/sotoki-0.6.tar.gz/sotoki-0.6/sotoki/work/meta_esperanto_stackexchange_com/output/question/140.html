    <div class="body"><p>To get some clarification into this, I propose voting on whether basic misspellings and correction of cx and ch into ĉ should be allowed. 
Important point: When quoting from a source that uses the x- or h-system, one might want to keep this and not over-correct.</p>

<p>Addition: 
This is not a duplicate of "what should our standpoint be on edits?", it's to add a clarification to that. Plus, see the answer which proposes posting questions like these (in that question).</p>

<p>Of course we should edit all cx's and ch's into ĉ! Misspellings in English are also all corrected, especially those that hinder an understanding of the question.
We still might leave quotes in original x- or h-sistemo, that's up to the editer and original questioner.</p>

            <span class="text">@kiamlaluno I actually think that it is a good idea to use the meta like this in order to be able to make decisions together. In that case the same person can post the question and several options, and there shouldn't be any downvoting. Of course, these kinds of meta-posts aren't how they were intended at first, but it is the best solution I can think of.

<p>But don't overdo it. I would simply correct <em>definas</em> to <em>difinas</em> and <em>PIV difinas la vorto</em> to <em>PIV difinas la vorton</em>. But if someone wrote <em>Tiu frazo ne estas korekta</em>, I could possibly add a comment about the dubious nature of the word <em>korekta</em>. I would not harshly change the word. Some people and even the Academy frown upon it, others approve of it, both of them with good reasons. We are not the inquisition dealing with heretics.</p>

Later I noticed that someone else had corrected the word and the trick probably was first deleting the word, perhaps even more to satisty the odd system, and then adding the same text with the "e" changed to I". – Perhaps I'm wrong.

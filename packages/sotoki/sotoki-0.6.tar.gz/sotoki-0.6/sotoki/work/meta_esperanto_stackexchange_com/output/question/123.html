    <div class="body"><p>How much should we edit? I see the value in the ability to improve questions and answers made by other users, but I also believe editing has some downsides to it. </p>

<p>Having your question edited, your original text turning up all red on your screen isn't very encouraging. Small things as removing greetings, changing titles and removing tags such as "grammar", are they really necessary? I think we lose more than we gain here. </p>

<p>Why edit back and forth? There are things we all have different opinions on. And instead of editing back and forth, we should discuss what should be allowed and not, in the meta. Whether or not "in Esperanto" should be allowed in titles is a such example. Another is about the above mentioned "grammar"-tag. We should vote about what we want. If the outcome is that it doesn't matter, if these things appear in posts, they shouldn't be removed through editing. </p>

<p>Of course there are things that are simply wrong. I'm not saying we should stop editing. Also, we can't vote about everything. But rearding the most common edits, I think we should come to an agreement. </p>

    <div class="body"><p>I am in favor of correcting typos, converting the x-system and similar systems to ĉapeloj, improving formatting, adding translations to E-o or En, and correcting grammar or vocabulary usage, in cases where there is an obvious error, such as using <em>necesas</em> instead of <em>bezonas</em> and the like. I would advise against stylistic edits in general, as they can sometimes change the meaning of what was said, or be perceived as doing so, and that can annoy the original posters, who may have had specific reasons for phrasing it how they did. While we want posts to be clear and readable, and so stylistic edits may at times be necessary, I think they should be avoided when they aren't necessary.</p>

    <div class="body"><p>My experience so far is that the edits I've seen have not always been beneficial. The first two times my text was edited, I felt it changed the meaning so I edited it back. The third time, I had quoted a dead, archived web page. When I wrote my comment I considered converting the quotation from the X-system, but I opted not to because of the context and that it was a quotation. Someone thought it should be converted, so I left that edit alone. (Not a big deal.)</p>

<p>I do appreciate edits and comments for spelling mistakes. Some help in formatting is always appreciated.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some times where I think some editing might be useful - such as translating an short answer and posting the translation as part of the original answer - especially when having a long discussion about the thing might take more effort. I don't see lot of that happening.</p>

    <div class="body"><p>One of my questions has a discussion in the comments about questioners looking up words in a dictionary before posting a question here on Stack Exchange. </p>

<p>To what extent is asking for a translation of a "simple" word fine? And how do I know if it is simple or not?</p>

<p>Theoretically, all root words can be looked up in a dictionary, but that doesn't mean we understand them. It is probably better to have a more "complicated" question than just "how do you say X in Esperanto?", but what is it that our user base needs? What is it that our team of expert can and wants to provide?</p>

<p>I read a question on German SE where the comment on a word was, basically "there is a Wikipedia page about this already, do you want to close your question now?". I found that a bit extreme...</p>

    <div class="body"><p>Generally no, but <strong>yes in two obvious cases</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the <strong>dictionnaries where the word is accurately translated are hard to access</strong>. If you have to pay for a book to be able to access a translation, then it means that people after you will face the same problem. Adding the question in Stack Exchange will help all Esperanto-speakers of the Internet access the information. Also, if the word was translated in an unknown dictionnary hidden in the tenth page of Google, we can not expect people to have checked the word on it.</p></li>
<li><p>When <strong>people are dubious or disagree with how a word was translated</strong> (they have to explain why in the content of the question). This may be common for technical terms. Not everything in Komputeko (or other word-lists) is good, and people may want to have an input from the community before using a word listed there.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Writing a question in Stack Exchange can take some time, especially for newcomers. It is often quicker to make an extensive search with Google. So if I newcommer ask for a meaning of a word, I think we should believe him if he says he had trouble finding a translation. He might not be alone.</p>

<ul>
<li>It doesn't encourage learners to become self-sufficient.</li>
<li>It takes time away from other questions which can't be looked up.</li>
<li>The dictionary authors worked hard on their dictionaries and deserve to be paid - and copying the entries from the dictionaries is ultimately a form of plagiarism.</li>
<li>It floods the database with low-value questions.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the very least, people asking for single word translations should be encouraged to mention what dictionaries they checked and what translations they considered before asking.</p>

<p>If a question not having done this research appears, I think we should answer with a short answer quoting the relevant dictionary, so that people learn by example. </p>

    <div class="body"><p>I think we should fully accept questions in English and/or Esperanto and have a friendly, tolerant and constructive attitude towards those who can't speak either.</p>

<p>Considerations:</p>

<ul>
<li>English: This is the de facto lingua franca of the internet. It is the working language of Stack Exchange. It will be understood at least passively by a huge number of native and non-native speakers who are still struggling with Esperanto. (Added: Currently the vast majority of questions are in English. Not allowing questions in English might cause some askers to use Esperanto, but I suspect we would also lose a lot of traffic - reducing the chance for the site to ever leave beta.)</li>
<li>Esperanto: For an Esperanto-focused site, this is basically a no-brainer for many reasons.</li>
<li>Reasons for accepting every other language: Speakers of rare languages may have specific problems learning Esperanto and may not be able to express them adequately in English or Esperanto. This is valuable information, and it's also important to extend the overall friendliness and openness of the Esperanto community to this case.</li>
<li>Reasons for restricting use of other languages: If a question is written only in a language other than English or Esperanto, the number of people who can contribute or make use of the information will be seriously reduced. (We also shouldn't conserve chain letters in Guuguu-Yimithirr or fragments of the Voynich manuscript until someone can identify them.)</li>
<li>(Added later) Experience from German language SE: Over there, both English and German are accepted. It is rare that someone asks in another language, but if/when this happens, disruption through attempts to prevent it appears to be more of a problem than the actual questions. (In practice, what is surprisingly contentious is questions about the very closely related Yiddish language, for which no equivalent site will exist in the foreseeable future. These questions generate a lot of interest and get high quality answers, but some want to forbid them. Some even want to forbid the discussion of German dialects. I never understood why, as this only alienates people who will then not have any SE site for their questions. The equivalent problem here probably needs to be discussed, but not under this question.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on these considerations, I would suggest something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Questions in English are welcome. It's OK if someone wants to add a (good!) translation into Esperanto, but normally there is no need for anyone to do this.</li>
<li>Questions in Esperanto are welcome. It's OK if someone wants to add a (good!) translation into English, but normally there is no need for anyone to do this.</li>
<li>Those who have trouble expressing a question in English or Esperanto may use any other language instead. The choice of language by itself is then only a reason to remove such a question if it turns out that nobody can answer it in the same language or translate it into English or Esperanto. Those who are able to do so are encouraged to translate such a question to English and/or Esperanto.</li>
<li>Questions in English should be answered in English or in Esperanto. If in doubt, in the case of typical beginners' questions, users are encouraged to answer in English or very simple Esperanto.</li>
<li>Questions in Esperanto should be answered in Esperanto or in English. If in doubt, users are encouraged to answer in Esperanto.</li>
<li>Questions in another language should be answered Esperanto, English or the other language.</li>
<li>When a question is asked again, but in a different language, this may be a good occasion to translate the original question and its best answer(s) into English and/or Esperanto. But only if someone can be bothered.</li>
<li>It is not acceptable to be rude to someone for using the 'wrong' language.</li>
<li>Translations are <em>added</em> to the original texts. It's OK to change the title to English or Esperanto and to make a question that is in neither language less prominent than its translation. But normally the question should be also preserved in its original language.</li>
<li>All rules are supposed to make sense. If for some reason they are counterproductive in a <em>special</em> case, they can always be broken.</li>
<li>This is not an actual rule. I just felt that having precisely 10 items would make this look like a carefully thought-through, complete and formal proposal ready for voting, which it isn't.</li>

<p><em>Inteligenta persono lernas Esperanton facile kaj rapide.</em></p>

<p>In a bilingual site where the same people are asking and answering questions in both Esperanto and English, there is no value to translating an answer like that. Sometimes, I just don't notice what language a question is in. I read it and answer it. In a bilingual site, there needs to be some tolerance of the "wrong" language and on mixed language answers.</p>

<p>Furthermore, rather than commenting that the answer is in the wrong language, it would be more constructive to edit the answer, draw a line at the bottom, then provide a translation underneath if you really feel one is necessary.</p>

            <span class="text">StackExchange questions are meant to help not only the asker, but anyone that goes back to that question to seek for the information they need. Not limiting the language to Esperanto and English only would make the site become one big mess of languages, and that won't allow others to get the information they need in a fluent way. Also, StackExchange is a <em>de facto</em> English network (except for sites that are tagged "X in &lt;language&gt;", but this is obvious)</span> – <a href="../user/65/Yotam-Salmon.html">Yotam Salmon </a> – <span class="date" title="2016-08-24T10:30:26.043">2016-08-24T10:30:26.043</span>

            <span class="text">I think it could be useful to have in place a system where, if someone does come along who doesn't know English or Esperanto well, they can still attempt to submit a question and with our pooled resources here we can help convert their question to English or Esperanto. That leaves them with the problem of receiving answers only in English or Esperanto, but perhaps someone who knows their language can assist by voluntarily translating certain answers by request. It's not perfectly fair, but it at least provides <em>some</em> method for non-EN, non-EO speaking users to participate.</span> – <a href="../user/353/Kat-No.html">Kat Ño </a> – <span class="date" title="2016-10-10T04:37:02.533">2016-10-10T04:37:02.533</span>

            <span class="text">And in addition, I think it would be a way to involve the vast part of the Internet that isn't English or Esperanto speaking into this Esperanto Language SE resource, without it becoming incredibly chaotic. It would be more of a volunteer type service by our polyglot/bilingual users, not an obligation, and not a linguistic free for all, either.</span> – <a href="../user/353/Kat-No.html">Kat Ño </a> – <span class="date" title="2016-10-10T04:40:10.257">2016-10-10T04:40:10.257</span>

            <span class="text">We should certainly be patient with non-English speakers who still aren't particularly skilled in Esperanto.  It wouldn't hurt to post a question in both Spanish and in low-quality Esperanto – that would allow someone here to improve the Esperanto translation based on the Spanish.  But allowing the same question to be asked in many different languages would be very difficult to maintain.</span> – <a href="../user/9/Nathaniel.html">Nathaniel </a> – <span class="date" title="2016-08-24T12:06:52.587">2016-08-24T12:06:52.587</span>

    <div class="body"><p>Related to the questions about vocabulary which should be answerable by simply looking in a dictionary, should there be a limit on very basic questions?</p>

<p>Examples of questions which may be too basic:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do you form the future tense of the word <em>kuras</em>?</li>
<li>What are the personal pronouns in Esperanto?</li>
<li>Is it <em>mi havas hundo</em> or <em>mi havas hundon</em>?</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems to me that Stack Exchange should not be a beginner's course in Esperanto - and there are already good ways to get questions like the above answered. They're highly individual as well, so keeping them around to be reused doesn't have as much value.</p>

            <span class="text">I think you caught my meaning. When a person is learning Esperanto, they have a lot of questions like "why does this sentence have an -n here" and "why is there no -n here". As for closing questions as dups, I'm not sure how that would work. That's like holding a class and the teacher answering "read the book."</span> – <a href="../user/297/Tomaso-Alexander.html">Tomaso Alexander </a> – <span class="date" title="2016-11-02T16:55:05.840">2016-11-02T16:55:05.840</span>

    <div class="body"><p>I see no reason to add artificial constraints to the acceptability of questions based on the level of Esperanto. If a question is low-level, experts don't have to answer necessarily, they can let other Esperanto-speakers answer. It is not a course. It is collaboration. Every Esperanto-speaker should be able to participate in answers, because no one is totally ignorant. Diversity of the level of questions is good for this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do you form the future tense of the word kuras?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a good question if a similar question never has been asked before.</p>

<p>If a similar question happens several times, people can edit the question to "<em>How do you form the future tense of the verb</em>" and link the newer duplicates to it.</p>

            <span class="text">To reiterate what Vanege said; from a community point of view some of the easier questions allow those of us who are are selves beginners to take part in answering questions and contributing to this stack exchange; there is no need for experts to answer. It is also useful to have lots of routes to canonical answers like "how to form the accusative" because a question like "How do you form the future tense of the word kuras?" might be prompted by an example in a course or on Duolingo and so might be googled by others.</span> – <a href="../user/97/conor.html">conor </a> – <span class="date" title="2016-11-04T07:50:23.180">2016-11-04T07:50:23.180</span>

            <span class="text">To this last point, we recently received a fairly basic question - whether you use a -n after <em>da</em> - and someone who has been around at least a little while answered the question. The answer was true, but didn't really explain the basic point - the -n is not used after prepositions to indicate the object of a sentence. If you come to Stack Exchange looking for expert advice, you should be hearing from experts.</span> – <a href="../user/297/Tomaso-Alexander.html">Tomaso Alexander </a> – <span class="date" title="2016-12-22T09:57:52.260">2016-12-22T09:57:52.260</span>

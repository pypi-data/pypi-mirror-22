    <div class="body"><p>What is the appropriate way to raise the question of whether a question is unanswerable? Is there a way to flag this, or is this brought up in the answers or comments?</p>

<p>One particular kind of "unanswerable question" I have in mind are questions along the lines of "what is the best way to learn X." For most elements of Esperanto, there is no one best way to learn it. People are different. Learning styles are different. Some methods work for some and not others. Some methods work more or less as well as others.</p>

Studies and data can be used to bring more objective answers and useful information. Also, best ways to learn X do exist depending on the profiles of the learners. A good answer could show the most common profiles and the best methods associated with them.</span> – <a href="../user/6/Vanege.html">Vanege </a> – <span class="date" title="2016-09-16T17:43:17.360">2016-09-16T17:43:17.360</span>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question is completely unclear, incomplete, overly-broad, primarily opinion-based</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last two cover unanswerable questions.</p>

<p>In my opinion however, it is best to vote for closure only if the question is obviously silly and provocative, or the number of responses is getting out of hand, or there is a great deal of unpleasantness in the comments.</p>

            <span class="text">Thanks kind of what I was asking. There already are questions of the form "what is the best way to learn X" - and I would say that this question is clearly "unanswerable", since there is no single best way -- at the same time, it is not an "obviously silly" question, neither is it out of hand. I don't want to flag things unnecessarily.</span> – <a href="../user/297/Tomaso-Alexander.html">Tomaso Alexander </a> – <span class="date" title="2016-09-16T12:40:09.183">2016-09-16T12:40:09.183</span>

If you feel for some reason that it is unanswerable, pointing that out in a comment is appropriate. (Unless one of the closing reasons apply).</p>

<p>If you attempt an answer, pointing out the unanswerability seems appropriate. Maybe the question was just improperly phrased and the way you answered clarified it. </p>

    <div class="body"><p>There are 4 closing reasons that would apply to questions (excluding the <em>duplicate</em> reason):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>unclear what you're asking<br>
The question is not clear, and it is not possible to understand what is being asked</p></li>
<li><p>too broad<br>
The question would require to write a too long answer, since it is not being specific enough</p></li>
<li><p>primarily opinion-based<br>
The question is asking the opinion of users, or it is subjective</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the case you are describing, a question asking for the <em>best way</em> is subjective: What is the best way for a person could not be the best way for somebody else. This is also true when learning a language: What helped me to learn a language could not be the best way for somebody else.</p>

<p>If none of the closing reasons applies, then the question should not be closed. </p>

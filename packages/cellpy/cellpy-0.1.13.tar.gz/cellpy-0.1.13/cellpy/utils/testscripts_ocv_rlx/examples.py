    v_co is actually not initial value in this case because the of ohmic
    resistance, r_0, isn't incorporated in this example. r_0 will make the v_co
    jump almost instant to a higher value. In real applications, r_0 need to be
    properly incorporated in ocv voltage. It's basically just to add a voltage
    v_0 that will add to the final ocv voltage.

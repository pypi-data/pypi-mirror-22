## About mathpy

mathpy is a collection of mathematical and statistical functions encompassing several different
fields such as linear algebra, numerical analysis, and number theory. The package is intended to
work with other popular scientific computing packages such as numpy and scipy. Most functions in
The mathpy package are also available as Excel UDFs for users who prefer working in Excel. The
mathpy project is primarily a personal project intended to develop a deeper understanding of
the mathematics and algorithmic implementations of various mathematical topics.

## Documentation

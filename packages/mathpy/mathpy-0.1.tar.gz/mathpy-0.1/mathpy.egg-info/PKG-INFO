        ## About mathpy
        
        mathpy is a collection of mathematical and statistical functions encompassing several different
        fields such as linear algebra, numerical analysis, and number theory. The package is intended to
        work with other popular scientific computing packages such as numpy and scipy. Most functions in
        The mathpy package are also available as Excel UDFs for users who prefer working in Excel. The
        mathpy project is primarily a personal project intended to develop a deeper understanding of
        the mathematics and algorithmic implementations of various mathematical topics.
        
        ## Documentation
        
        The documentation of the mathpy package is available here:

Description: ================

        .. Overview
        
        PySimpleAutomata is a Python library to manage Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA),
        Nondeterministic Finite Automata(NFA) and Alternate Finite state automata on Word (AFW).
        
        This library is not meant for performance nor space consumption optimization,
        but for academic purposes:
        *PySimpleAutomata aims to be an easily readable but working representation of automata theory*.
        
        .. Disclaimer
        
        This project has been developed for "Process and Service Modelling and Analysis" class
        of Master of Science in Engineering in Computer Science from Sapienza University of Rome.

        ------------
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        The project is **Python3 only**, tested on Python 3.5 and 3.6.
        
        `Graphviz - Graph Visualization Software <http://graphviz.org//>`_ is required to be installed and
        present on system path to input/output dot files, while
        Python packages `pydot <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pydot/>`_ and
        `graphviz <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/graphviz>`_ are used to handle them (respectively input and output).
        
        `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org//>`_ is used to generate the documentation.
        
        `Unittest <https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html>`_ for Unit testing.
        
        
        ------------
        Installation
        ------------
        
        From `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ using pip::
        
           pip install pysimpleautomata
        
        From source::
        
           python setup.py install
           pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        It is advised in any case to use a `Python Virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_ instead of a global installation.

        or `download it <https://readthedocs.org/projects/pysimpleautomata/downloads/>`_.

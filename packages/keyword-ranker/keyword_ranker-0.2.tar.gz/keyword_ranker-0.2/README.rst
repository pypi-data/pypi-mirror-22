keyword\_ranker
===============

| The Keyword Ranker uses the Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction
  algorithm
| (RAKE) to extract the most relevant keywords from a reference corpus,
| and ranks them depending on the degree to which they are represented
  in other
| benchmark documents.

Setup
-----

Using pip
~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

    pip install keyword_ranker

Directly from the repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

    git clone hhttps://github.com/sbadecker/keyword_ranker.git
    python keyword_ranker/setup.py install

Dependencies
------------

| This package requires the modules NLTK and six and will install them
  if necessary.
| To use lemmatization, nltk.corpus.wordnet is required an will be
  downloaded if necessary.

Languages
---------

| This package comes with an English stopwords list. You can specify
  your own set of stopwords by adding the filepath as an argument
  (stopwords\_path).
| As of now, lemmatization is only supported in for English documents.

Usage
-----

.. code:: python

    from keyword_ranker.kwr import KeywordRanker

    kr = KeywordRanker()

    kr.fit() # Extracts and scores the keywords from the corpus.
    # example: kr.fit(corpus.txt)

    kr.rank() # Ranks the n highest scoring corpus keywords with regards to the provided documents.
    # example: kr.rank(10, document1.txt, document2.txt)

| This package uses a Python implementation of the RAKE algorithm as
  mentioned in paper `Automatic keyword extraction from individual
  documents by Stuart Rose, Dave Engel, Nick Cramer and Wendy Cowley`_.
| The original code included in rake.py can be found here:
  https://github.com/zelandiya/RAKE-tutorial. It has been extended by me
  to support lemmatization using WordNetLemmatizer from the NLTK.

Versions of python this code is tested against

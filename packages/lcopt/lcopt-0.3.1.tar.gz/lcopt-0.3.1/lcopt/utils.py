	Utility function to set up brightway2 to work correctly with lcopt.

	It requires the path to the ecospold files containing the Ecoinvent 3.3 cutoff database.

	If you don't have these files, log into `ecoinvent.org  <http://www.ecoinvent.org/login-databases.html>`_ and go to the Files tab

	Download the file called ``ecoinvent 3.3_cutoff_ecoSpold02.7z``

	Extract the file somewhere sensible on your machine, you might need to download `7-zip <http://www.7-zip.org/download.html>`_ to extract the files.

	Make a note of the path of the folder that contains the .ecospold files, its probably ``<path/extracted/to>/datasets/``

	Use this path (as a string) as the first parameter in this function

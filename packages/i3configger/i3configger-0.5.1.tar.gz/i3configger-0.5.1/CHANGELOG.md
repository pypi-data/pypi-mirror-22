# CHANGELOG

## Unreleased

- nothing yet

## 0.5.0 (Half way there) - 2017-06-08

### Added

- proper documentation at http://oliver.bestwalter.de/i3configger/
- copy user or default config into `config.d` on initialization

### Removed

- end of line comments are not supported anymore (too much bug potential - would need some form of parsing already to make it work -> not worth the fuzz)

### Changed

- comments are not stripped from the build anymore
- notification is off by default: cli arg changed from `--no-notify-` to `--notify`

### Fixed

- checking the config with `i3 -C` did not work because `-c` (small c) was not passed and the passed path to the new config was silently ignored and the active config was checked instead

## 0.4.4 (I am not alone) - 2017-06-05

### Fixed

-[#2](https://github.com/obestwalter/i3configger/issues/2) - fails if not using i3status. Fixed by making the refresh call ignore any errors - not nice, just a quick fix.

## 0.4.3 - (The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time) - 2017-06-04

### Added

* examples that are used as test cases

### Fixed

* some small fixes regarding selection

## 0.4.2 (The answer) - 2017-06-03

**Basic implementation**

* build main config and one or several i3status configs from the same sources
* variables are handled slightly more intelligently than i3 does it (variables assigned to other variables are resolved)
* end of line comments are possible (removed at build time)
* variables in i3status configs are also resolved (set anywhere in the sources)
* reload or restart i3 when a change has been done (using `i3-msg`)
* notify when new config has been created and activated (using `notify-send`)
* simple way to render partials based on key value pairs in file name
* simple way to change the configuration by sending messages
* build config as one shot script or watch for changes
* send messages to watching i3configger process
* if `i3 -C fails` with the newly rendered config, the old config will be kept, no harm done

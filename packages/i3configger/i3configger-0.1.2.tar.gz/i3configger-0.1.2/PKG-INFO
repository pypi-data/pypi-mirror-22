        ===========
        
        |Project Status: Active – The project has reached a stable, usable state
        and is being actively developed.|
        
        Generate i3 config files from a set of partial config files in a config
        folder. Do some nifty conditional integration and variable resolution
        (aslo for i3status configs). This makes switching of themes (optical or
        key bindings or whatever) possible and things like having per host
        settings.
        
        Example
        -------
        
        I use this generate my own config. See `my i3
        config <https://github.com/obestwalter/i3config>`__:
        `.i3/config.d <https://github.com/obestwalter/i3config/tree/master/config.d>`__
        
        The call:
        
        ::
        
            $ i3configger --select-host=$(hostname) --select-theme=solarized-dark
        
        Creates
        `config <https://github.com/obestwalter/i3config/tree/master/config>`__
        and
        `i3status.main.conf <https://github.com/obestwalter/i3config/tree/master/i3status.main.conf>`__
        from the sources.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        -  build main config and one or several i3status configs from the same
           sources
        -  render variables slightly more intelligently than i3 does it
        -  also render variables in i3status configs (set anywhere in the
           sources)
        -  reload or restart i3 when a change has been done (using ``i3-msg``)
        -  notify when new config has been created and activated (using
           ``notify-send``)
        -  conditional building of config depending on settings
        -  simple way to communicate settings to renderer
        -  build config as one shot script or watch for changes (foreground and
           daemon)
        
        Some things are still in the air - see `notes <notes.md>`__.

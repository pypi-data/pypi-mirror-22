## Some inspiration from i3 project

> * Never break configuration files or existing workflows. Breaking changes require a major version bump (v4 → v5).
* Keep mental complexity low: once you know i3’s key features, other features should be easy to understand.
* Only add features which benefit many people, instead of going to great lengths to support rarely used workflows.
* Only documented behavior is supported. Clear documentation is a requirement for contributions.

### Display specific bars on specific displays

Those bars should only be integrated if the display is present

Use http://python-xlib.sourceforge.net/doc/html/python-xlib_16.html to read display infos?

## Build on startup

It i3configger is started/run once before i3 is started the config can be build depending on settings and environments. e.g in xinitrc before i3wm is started.

e.g. which displays are connected and how should the workspaces and bars be configured according to that.

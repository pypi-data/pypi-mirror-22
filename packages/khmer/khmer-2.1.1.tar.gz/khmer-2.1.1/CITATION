      abstract ="Deep sequencing has enabled the investigation of a wide range of
  environmental microbial ecosystems, but the high memory requirements for de
  novo assembly of short-read shotgun sequencing data from these complex
  populations are an increasingly large practical barrier. Here we introduce a
  memory-efficient graph representation with which we can analyze the k-mer
  connectivity of metagenomic samples. The graph representation is based on a
  probabilistic data structure, a Bloom filter, that allows us to efficiently
  store assembly graphs in as little as 4 bits per k-mer, albeit inexactly. We
  show that this data structure accurately represents DNA assembly graphs in low
  memory. We apply this data structure to the problem of partitioning assembly
  graphs into components as a prelude to assembly, and show that this reduces the
  overall memory requirements for de novo assembly of metagenomes. On one soil
  metagenome assembly, this approach achieves a nearly 40-fold decrease in the
  maximum memory requirements for assembly. This probabilistic graph
  representation is a significant theoretical advance in storing assembly graphs
  and also yields immediate leverage on metagenomic assembly.",

  nucleotide sequence analysis, including data preprocessing for de novo

  khmer software package for fast and memory efficient <italic>online</italic>
  counting of k-mers in sequencing data sets. Unlike previous methods based on
  data structures such as hash tables, suffix arrays, and trie structures, khmer
  relies entirely on a simple probabilistic data structure, a Count-Min Sketch.
  The Count-Min Sketch permits online updating and retrieval of k-mer counts in
  memory which is necessary to support online k-mer analysis algorithms. On
  sparse data sets this data structure is considerably more memory efficient than
  any exact data structure. In exchange, the use of a Count-Min Sketch introduces
  a systematic overcount for k-mers; moreover, only the counts, and not the
  k-mers, are stored. Here we analyze the speed, the memory usage, and the
  miscount rate of khmer for generating k-mer frequency distributions and
  retrieving k-mer counts for individual k-mers. We also compare the performance
  of khmer to several other k-mer counting packages, including Tallymer,
  Jellyfish, BFCounter, DSK, KMC, Turtle and KAnalyze. Finally, we examine the
  effectiveness of profiling sequencing error, k-mer abundance trimming, and
  digital normalization of reads in the context of high khmer false positive
  rates. khmer is implemented in C++ wrapped in a Python interface, offers a
  tested and robust API, and is freely available under the BSD license at

    ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: The use of novel algorithmic techniques is pivotal
    to many important problems in life science. For example the sequencing of
    the human genome [1] would not have been possible without advanced assembly
    algorithms. However, owing to the high speed of technological progress and
    the urgent need for bioinformatics tools, there is a widening gap between
    state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques and the actual algorithmic
    components of tools that are in widespread use. RESULTS: To remedy this
    trend we propose the use of SeqAn, a library of efficient data types and
    algorithms for sequence analysis in computational biology. SeqAn comprises
    implementations of existing, practical state-of-the-art algorithmic
    components to provide a sound basis for algorithm testing and development.
    In this paper we describe the design and content of SeqAn and demonstrate
    its use by giving two examples. In the first example we show an application
    of SeqAn as an experimental platform by comparing different exact string
    matching algorithms. The second example is a simple version of the well-
    known MUMmer tool rewritten in SeqAn. Results indicate that our
    implementation is very efficient and versatile to use. CONCLUSION: We
    anticipate that SeqAn greatly simplifies the rapid development of new
    bioinformatics tools by providing a collection of readily usable, well-
    designed algorithmic components which are fundamental for the field of
    sequence analysis. This leverages not only the implementation of new
    algorithms, but also enables a sound analysis and comparison of existing
    algorithms.},

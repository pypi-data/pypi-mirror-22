Audit interactions in real-time

In this example we create a shell with one simple command: audit

- command: audit
- provides clear status if this room is currently audited or not

- command: audit on
- starts auditing

- command: audit off
- ensure private interactions


To run this script you have to provide a custom configuration, or set
environment variables instead::

- ``CHAT_ROOM_MODERATORS`` - You have at least your e-mail address
- ``CHAT_TOKEN`` - Received from Cisco Spark when you register your bot
- ``SERVER_URL`` - Public link used by Cisco Spark to reach your server

The token is specific to your run-time, please visit Cisco Spark for
Developers to get more details:

    https://developer.ciscospark.com/

For example, if you run this script under Linux or macOs with support from
ngrok for exposing services to the Internet::

    export CHAT_ROOM_MODERATORS="alice@acme.com"
    export CHAT_TOKEN="<token id from Cisco Spark for Developers>"
    export SERVER_URL="http://1a107f21.ngrok.io"
    python hello.py

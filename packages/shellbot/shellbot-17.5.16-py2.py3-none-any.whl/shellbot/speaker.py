        Continuously send updates

        This function is looping on items received from the queue, and
        is handling them one by one in the background.

        Processing should be handled in a separate background process, like
        in the following example::

            speaker = Speaker(bot=bot)

            process = Process(target=speaker.work)
            process.daemon = True
            process.start()

        The recommended way for stopping the process is to change the
        parameter ``general.switch`` in the context. For example::

            bot.context.set('general.switch', 'off')

        Alternatively, the loop is also broken when an exception is pushed
        to the queue. For example::

            bot.mouth.put(Exception('EOQ'))

        Note that items are not picked up from the queue until the underlying
        space is ready for handling messages.

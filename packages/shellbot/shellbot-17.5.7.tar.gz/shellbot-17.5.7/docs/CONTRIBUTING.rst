How to contribute to Shellbot?
==============================

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every
little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

You are not a developer? We are glad that you are involved
----------------------------------------------------------

You can contribute in many ways:

* submit feedback
* report bugs
* write documentation
* fix bugs
* implement features

Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue. The place to go is
`Shellbot issues at GitHub`_. There you can check if your feedback is new, or
if you can align with others.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

Report Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~

Have you identified some bug? Thanks to go to `Shellbot issues at GitHub`_.
This is the place where issues are documented, discussed, and fixed. We really
value your time and effort to report bugs.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

Write Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shellbot could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official shellbot docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

Fix Bugs
~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug"
is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Implement Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "feature"

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up Shellbot for local development
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Fork the `shellbot` repo on `GitHub`_. If you do not have an account there
   yet, you have to create one, really. This is provided for free, and will
   make you a proud member of a global community that matters. Once you have
   authenticated, visit the `Shellbot repository at GitHub`_ and click
   on the `Fork` link.

2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/shellbot.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper
   installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv shellbot
    $ cd shellbot/
    $ pip install -e .

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the tests::

    $ make lint
    $ make test
    $ make coverage

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.

2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in ``README.rst``.

3. Check `Shellbot continuous integration at Travis CI`_
   and make sure that the tests pass there.

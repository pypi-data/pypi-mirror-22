.SH DESCRIPTION

Create an image from a previously prepared image root directory.
The kiwi create call is usually issued after a kiwi prepare command
and builds the requested image type in the specified target directory
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-root\fB= <directory>
Path to the image root directory. This directory is usually created
by the kiwi prepare command. If a directory is used which was not
created by kiwi’s prepare command, it’s important to know that kiwi
stores image build metadata below the image/ directory which needs
to be present in order to let the create command operate correctly.
.TP
.BI \-\-target\-dir\fB= <directory>
Path to store the build results.

Introduction to Dummydata
=========================

Dummydata is a package that allows to generate geospatial data fields with predefined statistical properties and store these as netCDF files.

Installation
============

Currently the package is available from `github <https://github.com/pygeo/dummydata>`_ and can be installed in addition via `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ or `conda <https://conda.io/docs/index.html>`_ .

using github
------------

To install the package from the git sources, just do the following::

    # to get the development version
    cd <SOME TEMPORARY DIRECTORY>
    wget https://github.com/pygeo/dummydata/archive/master.zip
    unzip master.zip
    cd dummydata-master
    python setup.py install

using pip
---------

To install the package using pip, just do the following::

    pip install dummydata

using conda (not working yet)
-----------------------------

To install via conda do the following::

    conda install [-n YOURENV] -c conda-forge dummydata



How it works
============

Dummydata allows to generate either two dimensional data fiels with a time vector (e.g. sea surface temperature fields) or a 3D variable with an additional vertical coordinate.

Currently regular lat/lon grids are supported for coordinates.

A small example that generates a random dataset with dimensions (time, lat, lon) is provided as follows

.. code:: python

    from dummydata import Model2

    # generate a 2D variable
    M2 = Model2(start_year=2003,stop_year=2014)

This generates a monthly timeseries starting 1st of January 2003 and ending 31.12.2014. A netCDF file will be automatically generated and closed. To generate a field of vertical air temperture profiles a script would could look as follows:

.. code:: python

    from dummydata import Model3

    # generate a 3D variable
    M3 = Model3(var='ta', oname='air_temperature',start_year=1998,stop_year=2002)

This will generate a file *air_temperature.nc* from 1998 to 2002 with a variable named *ta*.

The dummy data which is generated includes common metadata for different variable types. The tool therefore contains already a set of predefined variables with predefined metadata. The current list of supported variables can be found in the file *meta.py*. In case a user wants to add additional variable options, the necessary metadata information has to be included in the dictionary specified in *meta.py*.



Characteristics and options
---------------------------

The following options are currently available:

var : string : optional
    specifies the name of the variable to be generated; note that the variable name needs to be part of the defined variables in *meta.py*

oname : string : optional
    name of netCDF output file to be generated

start_year : int : obligatory
    start year for dataset to be generated

stop_year : int : obligatory
    stop year for dataset to be generated

method : string : obligatory
    method to be used for data generation. At the moment the following options are supported:

    * 'uniform' generates a white noise field
    * 'constant': generates a field with constant values; the *constant*  argument needs to be provided in that case as well.

constant : float : obligatory when method='constant'
    specifies the constant value to be used
    
append_coordinates : bool
    specifies if fields with coordinates should be appended
    
append_cellsize : bool
    specifies if fields with the cellsize information should be appended to the output file


Some further examples
---------------------

.. code:: python

    from dummydata import Model2, Model3

    # generate a 2D dataset with the value 5. everywhere
    M2 = Model2(method='constant', constant=5., oname='myconst5',start_year=1998,stop_year=2002)




Current limitations
-------------------

* only monthly sampling frequencies supported at the moment
* no min/max can be specified to specify the range of the values
* specification of metadata is currently rather limited and done in *meta.py* which is not very user friendly. As an alternative user specific configuration files could be used.

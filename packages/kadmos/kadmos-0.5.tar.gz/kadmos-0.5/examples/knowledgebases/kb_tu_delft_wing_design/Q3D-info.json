      "description": "Q3D stands for quasi-3D. Q3D is an aerodynamic solver that combines different analyses of a lifting surface in order to provide reliable characteristic values (lift, drag, etc.) with relatively low computational effort. In essence, Q3D combines the results of an inviscid vortex lattice method of the full wing geometry (using the software AVL) with the results of a viscous 2D Euler CFD analysis for a certain amount of 2D sections of the wing (using the software VGK or XFOIL)."

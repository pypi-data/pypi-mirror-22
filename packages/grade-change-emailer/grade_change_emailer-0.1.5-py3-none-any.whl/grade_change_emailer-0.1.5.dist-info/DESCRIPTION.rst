Grade Change Emailer
====================

This is a simple python script that checks for new grades at the FH
Aachen.

Configuration
-------------

Copy the ``example.ini`` to ``default.ini`` in your OS-specfic user
config directory and fill in the necessary details. You can also place a
configuration file under ``/etc/grade_change_emailer.ini`` or specify a
custom location via env variable ``GRADE_CHANGE_EMAILER_CONFIG_FILE``.

Usage
-----

Run the script with ``grade_change_emailer``. Now everytime the script
runs it checks for new grades and e-mails you about it if that is the
case. Note that the script will always e-mail you the first time the
script is run. If you don't receive an e-mail, you misconfigured it. Go
and recheck all you login data. You might want to schedule this script
with something like **cron** to automate the grade checking.

Dependencies
------------

This scripts depends on **Python 3**, the **requests**, the **appdirs**
and the **BeautifulSoup4** package from python.

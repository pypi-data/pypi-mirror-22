  Download a file from a URL to one of the following destinations:

  :param filename: A filename to write the downloaded file to.
  :param file: A file-like object.
  :param directory: A directory. The filename will be automatically
    determined from the ``Content-Disposition`` header received from
    the server or the last path elemnet in the URL.

  Additional parameters for the *directory* parameter:

  :param on_exists: The operation to perform when the file already exists.
    Available modes are ``rename``, ``overwrite`` and ``skip``.

  Additional parameters:

  :param progress: A callable that accepts a single parameter that is a
    dictionary with information about the progress of the download. The
    dictionary provides the keys ``size``,  ``downloaded`` and ``response``.
    If the callable returns :const:`False` (specifically the value False), the
    download will be aborted and a :class:`UserInterrupt` will be raised.
  :param urlopen_kwargs: A dictionary with additional keyword arguments
    for :func:`urllib.request.urlopen`.

  Raise and return:

  :raise HTTPError: Can be raised by :func:`urllib.request.urlopen`.
  :raise URLError: Can be raised by :func:`urllib.request.urlopen`.
  :raise UserInterrupt: If the *progress* returned :const:`False`.
  :return: If the download mode is *directory*, the name of the downloaded
    file will be returned and False if the file was newly downloaded, True
    if the download was skipped because the file already existed.
    Otherwise, the number of bytes downloaded will be returned.

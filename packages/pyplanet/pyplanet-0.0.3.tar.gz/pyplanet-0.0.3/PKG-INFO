        Git Structure
        -------------
        
        Master is always the latest development environment. We develop features in different branches ``feature/*`` or ``app/*``.
        
        Crafting releases is done at the ``release/vX.X.X`` branches. The branch is created from the master at the moment the freeze moment goes in.
        Only bug fixes are accepted to be merged into the release/* branches, name these branches ``bugfix/ISSUE-ID``.
        
        After releasing (from the release branch) it gets a version tag. From this point there is no way back, new bug releases will be crafted
        from the release/version branch (``release/v0.1.0`` -> ``release/v0.1.2`` and is accepting merges from ``bugfix/*``).
        
        Visualization of our current release schedule can be found here: `Release Schedule <https://github.com/PyPlanet/PyPlanet/projects/3>`_
        
        Versioning
        ----------
        
        All PyPlanet versions bellow 1.0.0 are not using semantic versioning.
        After 1.0.0, there is a strict semantic versioning (v2) versioning policy in use.

flopymetascript
===============

Converts a zip with MODFLOW input files to a zip containing Flopy script
in different formats. This Flopy (Python) script can generate the
intitial MODFLOW input files.

It should work for all packages of MODFLOW, MT3D, and SEAWAT. For a
complete list, see the load supported packages in
https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy/blob/develop/docs/supported\_packages.md
.

No money is to be made by the author with this package. The author has
absolutely no convidense in that this script is correct and is not
responsible for the content and consequences of malicious scripts. I you
find it useful, please consider donating to charity (be creative in
choosing which one) and send me a note (or create and close an issue).
Thanks! The author is not affiliated with the modflow family nor with
Flopy. This converter/generator uses the Flopy load function. Any
errors/mistakes in the Flopy load functions propagate to the generated
script.

Use cases
=========

-  You are coming from a different modeling environment and want to
   start using Flopy
-  Clean up your flopy script/notebook
-  Add a description (and default value) to your parameters
-  Check someone else's MODFLOW input files / Flopy script
-  Check homework assignments

Advantages
==========

-  Returns .ipynb, py, tex, html, markdown, and rst file of your MODFLOW
   input files
-  Consistent and clean markup is used
-  All the parameters are defined explicitely
-  A description is loaded and interpreted from the flopy package
   directly. The same description as in the docs
   (modflowpy.github.io/flopydoc/) is used.
-  Makes use of smart broadcasting to reduce the size of the arrays
   printed to the script.

Install
=======

Enter in the terminal,

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install https://github.com/bdestombe/flopymetascript/zipball/master

The ``$``-sign should be omitted, and only refers to that the command is
to be entered in the bash-commandline. The flopymetascript package added
to system's ``$PATH`` and is reachable from any directory. Check if
everything works by typing in any directory,

.. code:: bash

    $ flopymetascript --help

Uninstall with,

.. code:: bash

    $ pip uninstall flopymetascript

Please see

for more information on the package structure.

Supported
=========

Currently only tested with several MODFLOW and SEAWAT models, on a
Mac-platform.

# Known issues
--------------

Example usage from the commandline:
===================================

With zipfiles
-------------

Try this first,

.. code:: bash

    $ flopymetascript --outbytesfile output.zip --inbytesfile input.zip --logfile log.txt

input.zip is a zip-file that contains MODFLOW input files and a single
.nam file. Its content is processed and written to output.zip. Some
logging is written to log.txt.

Using pipes
-----------

.. code:: bash

    $ openssl base64 -in input.zip -out input.zip.b64
    $ flopymetascript --outbytesfile output.zip --inbase64file input.zip.b64

input.zip is encoded to base64 and is used as input file for
flopymetascript

.. code:: bash

    $ flopymetascript --outbytesfile output.zip --inbase64file - < input.zip.b64

The content of input.zip.b64 is streamed/piped to flopymetascript

.. code:: bash

    $ openssl base64 -in input.zip | flopymetascript --outbytesfile output.zip --inbase64file -

The same as what is done previously, however input.zip is encoded and
instead of writing it to a file, it is passed as stdin to the
inbase64file argument of flopymetascript.

.. code:: bash

    $ openssl base64 -in input.zip | flopymetascript --outbase64file utput.zip --inbase64file - --logfile -

The log file is printed to stdout.

You cannot send both outbase64file and logfile to stdout. They will be
mixed and the resulting output file is not readable.

Example usage in python
=======================

This might need somework and is subject to change in the future.

.. code:: python

    from flopymetascript.flopymetascript import process

    # fn = 'input.zip.b64'
    # inbase64file = open(fn, 'r')
    # fn = 'output.zip.b64'
    # outbase64file = open(fn, 'w')
    fn = 'input.zip'
    inbytesfile = open(fn, 'rb')   # Dont forget the b
    fn = 'output.zip'
    outbytesfile = open(fn, 'rb')  # Dont forget the b
    fn = 'log.txt'
    logfile = open(fn, 'w')

    process(inbytesfile=inbytesfile, outbytesfile=outbytesfile, logfile=logfile)

    inbytesfile.close()
    outbytesfile.close()
    logfile.close()

Todo:
=====

-  Add additional packages with default values
-  Add a toggle to turn of the parameter description
-  Add line width as parameter

The analytics-python client is created by `Segment <https://segment.com>`_ 
and adapted by `Astronomer <http://www.astronomer.io/>`_.

It is the simplest way to integrate analytics into your application.
One API allows you to turn on any other analytics service. No more learning
new APIs, repeated code, and wasted development time.

This is the official Python client that wraps the 
`Astronomer API <https://www.astronomer.io/>`_.

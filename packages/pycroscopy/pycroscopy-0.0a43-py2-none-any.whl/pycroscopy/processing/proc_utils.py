    """
    Creates histogram for a single block of pixels

    Parameters
    ----------
    x_hist : 1D numpy array
        bins for x-axis of 2d histogram
    data_mat : numpy array
        data to be binned for y-axis of 2d histogram
    weighting_vec : 1D numpy array or float
        weights. If setting all to one value, can be a scalar
    N_x_bins : integer
        number of bins in the x-direction
    N_y_bins : integer
        number of bins in the y-direction
    min_resp : float
        minimum value for y binning
    max_resp : float
        maximum value for y binning
    func : function
        function to be used to bin data_vec.  All functions should take as input data_vec.
        Arguments should be passed properly to func.  This has not been heavily tested.

    Returns
    -------
    pixel_hist : 2D numpy array
        contains the histogram of the input data



    Apply func to input data, convert to 1D array, and normalize

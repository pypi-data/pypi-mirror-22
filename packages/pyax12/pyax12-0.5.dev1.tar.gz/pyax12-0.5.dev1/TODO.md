## Version 1.0

- [ ] Update "Connection.get_control_table_tuple()" such that only one
  Instruction Packet is send to the Dynamixel unit and only one (big) Status
  Packet is returned by the Dynamixel Unit.
- [ ] Add a "Connection.scan_multiple_baudrate()" function (or
  "Connection.discover_devices()") (it probably won't work under Windows
  because of the COM port configuration in the Device Manager)
- [ ] Make Connection.send() method more robust? See:
    - ROS: http://docs.ros.org/diamondback/api/dynamixel_driver/html/dynamixel__io_8py_source.html#l00085

- [ ] Improve the reliability of "Connection.send()".
- [ ] Fix missing data and tests:

          projects to Gitlab)"
    - [ ] http://savannah.nongnu.org/
- [ ] Complete the sphinx documentation to contain all the "Dynamixel User
  Manual" (the documentation should help users to connect dynamixels,
  understand how it works, ...).
- [ ] Add a "Features" section in the README.rst and sphinx docs.
- [ ] Add a "Troubleshooting" section in the README.rst and sphinx docs (should
  contain installation instructions relative to specific
  platforms/configurations).
- [ ] Add a "FAQ" section in the README.rst and sphinx docs.
- [ ] Use Tox (http://tox.testrun.org/) to run tests ?
- [ ] Implement `__str__` in Packet.
- [ ] Implement `__iter__` and `next` in Packet to make it iterable.
- [ ] Implement the `with` context manager in the Connection class (to
  automatically close serial connections).
- [ ] Check the "debian-dist.sh" script and build/publish a Debian packet.
- [ ] On Windows, how to automatically update the PATH variable (for
  C:\PYTHON34\Scripts) from pip or from a .bat ?
- [ ] Say somewhere in the documentation that (by default), with pip, the
  package is installed in C:\PYTHON34\libs\site-packages\
- [ ] Add a RPM package.
- [ ] Check the PyAX-12 installation (with pip and dedicated packages) and
  examples:
    - [ ] on Windows XP/Vista/8/10;
    - [ ] on MacOSX;
    - [ ] on Ubuntu/Fedora/SuSE/Arch/Mint/...;
    - [ ] on Raspbian/...;
    - [ ] with Python 3.0/3.1/3.2/3.3;
    - [ ] with PySerial 2.5/2.4/...
- [ ] Write functions "Packet.print_info()" and "Connection.print_info()" to
  print "human readable" informations (e.g. "position=...Â°\nspeed=..." ;
  "baudrate=...\nport=...\n...") ?
- [ ] Some unit tests "requires to be connected to the Dynamixel number 1 using
  port "/dev/ttyUSB0" (thus it works on Unix systems only) at 57600 baud." ->
  fix it... (especially in test_status_packet)
- [ ] Write a tutorial to explain how to use PyAX-12 on a RaspberryPi using
  GPIOs (i.e. without the usbdynamixel adapter) and without the CM-5 (i.e. using
  a batteries, a LiPo or a DC lab power supply instead).

  - See: www.oppedijk.com/robotics/control-dynamixel-with-raspberrypi
- [ ] Annoucements: raspberrypi.org, linuxfr, ...

## Misc

- [ ] Conform to google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html ?
- [ ] Write a MSI installer for Windows.
- [ ] Test "setup.py bdist_rpm ..." (create an RPM distribution)
- [ ] Test "setup.py bdist_wininst ..." (create an executable installer for MS Windows)
- [ ] Create a "pyax12gui" repository: a set of graphic tools (tkinter) on top
  of PyAX-12 to handle Dynamixels servos.

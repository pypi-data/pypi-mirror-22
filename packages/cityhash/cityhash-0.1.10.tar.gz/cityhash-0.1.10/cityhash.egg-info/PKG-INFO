        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        To use this package in your program, simply type
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install cityhash
        
        
        After that, you should be able to import the module and do things with it (see Example Usage below).
        
        Example Usage
        -------------
        
        The package contains 64- and 128-bit implementations of CityHash algorithm that
        are named as such:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> from cityhash import CityHash32, CityHash64, CityHash128
            >>> print(CityHash32("abc"))
            795041479
            >>> print(CityHash64("abc"))
            2640714258260161385
            >>> print(CityHash128("abc"))
            76434233956484675513733017140465933893
        
        Development
        -----------
        If you want to contribute to this package by developing, the included Makefile
        provides some useful commands to help you with that task:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            git clone https://github.com/escherba/python-cityhash.git
            cd python-cityhash
            make env           # creates a Python virtualenv
            make test          # runs both Python and C++ tests

        Authors
        -------
        The Python bindings were originally written by Alexander [Amper] Marshalov and
        were subsequently edited for more speed/versatility and packaged for PyPI by
        Eugene Scherba. The original CityHash algorithm is by Google.

Murdock: A Molecular Docking Framework
======================================

Murdock is a Python package for the development and testing of automated
`molecular docking`_ solutions. It has been developed as a convenient and
efficient platform to implement new search algorithms, scoring functions,
multi-step docking workflows and other features on a reliable platform, test
them quickly and use the rich output to analyse advantages, disadvantages and
issues of a new method. In addition, Murdock comes with a set of end-user
scripts and presets, so that it can be used by anyone solemly to obtain
scientific data, for which only a basic knowledge of command-line tools is
required.

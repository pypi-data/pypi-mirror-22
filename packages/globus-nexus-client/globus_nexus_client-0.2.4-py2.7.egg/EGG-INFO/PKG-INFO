Description: Disclaimer: This Is Not An Official Globus.org Product
        ===
        
        This is a personal project borne of my own frustration trying to interact with
        the Globus Nexus API.
        It is not a Globus maintained product.
        
        If you don't know what that is, stop reading here and go away.
        Otherwise, this will hopefully alleviate the pains of trying to use the
        unsupported ``python-nexus-client`` sample lib, which is remarkably terrible.
        
        
        Globus Nexus Client
        ===
        
        When Globus added the new `SDK <https://github.com/globus/globus-sdk-python`_
        it did not include functionality for the old Nexus API.
        
        This package contains a client for talking to Nexus, based on the same core
        client model provided by the SDK.
        You should therefore think of this as a third-party extension to the SDK for
        talking to Nexus.
        
        Importing and Usage
        ---
        
        Because this is not part of the SDK, you don't get at it with a simple
        ``from globus_sdk import NexusClient``.
        
        Instead, imports come from the package namespace::
        
            from globus_nexus_client import NexusClient
        
        You can then use ``NexusClient`` methods as usual.

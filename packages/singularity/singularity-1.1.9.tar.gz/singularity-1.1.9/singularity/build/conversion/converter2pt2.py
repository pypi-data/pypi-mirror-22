    MAINTAINER)

    :: note

    each KEY of the mapping should be a command start in the Dockerfile (eg, RUN)
    for each corresponding value, there should be a dictionary with the following:

        - section: the Singularity build file section to write the new command to
        - fun: any function to pass the output through before writing to the section (optional)
        - json: Boolean, if the section can optionally have json (eg a list)

    I'm not sure the subtle differences between add and copy, other than copy doesn't support
    external files. It should suffice for our purposes (for now) to use the same function 
    (parse_add) until evidence for a major difference is determined.

Join us, friends, and lift a few
Best of all, we'll pay for you!
But first you'll need to find the place
At which you'll want to show your face.
It's time to use your thinking cap
And don't forget to bring your map.
It's helpful also--don't be late!--
To figure out the time and date.
Remember, though, it's GMT
But minus 6 is when we'll be
So, friends, we hope to see you there,
Where we'll be saving you a chair.

        Updated testing matrix.
        
        Bumped testing to 100% branch coverage (in
        addition to long-held line-coverage).

    version: 1.8.5
    date: August 31, 2016
    notes: >
        Reinstated Python 3.2 support provisionally. It tests fine under
        Travis CI, even if my local 3.2 test rig can no longer effectively
        test 3.2. Updated Travis config for broader test coverage there,
        including the 3.6 "nightly" build.

        Achieves 100% test coverage and institutes new integrated
        test coverage measurments on every test run.

    version: 1.7.0
    date: August 11, 2015
    notes: >
        Doc tweaks. Bump to 1.7 to signify new development plateau and
        also to resolve a versioning glitch re PyPI (some mentions say
        1.3.9, others 1.6.9, which is no bueno).
-
    version: 1.6.9
    notes: >
        Simplifies packaging and testing config. Some doc tweaks.

-
    version: 1.6.8
    notes: >
        Adds wheel packaging and updates testing config.

-
    version: 1.6.7
    notes: >
        Switches from BSD to Apache License 2.0 and integrates
        ``tox`` testing with ``setup.py``

-
    version: 1.6.6
    notes: >
        Improves docs. Adds testing under Travis CI.

-
    version: 1.6.5
    notes: >
        Updates the testing matrix, packaging, and documentation.
        All vestiges of support for Python 2.5 and PyPy 1.9 and earlier
        are officially withdrawn; if you're still back there, upgrade alredy!

    version: 1.6.4
    notes: >
        ``decimal_entities()`` is a synonym for ``numeric_entities()``.

-
    version: 1.6.3
    notes: >
        ``entities()`` raises a bespoke ``UnknownEntities`` class rather
        that ``KeyError`` if you request an unknown type of entities. More important,
        an old version of ``namedentities`` that was interfering with automated ``pip``
        installations has been removed from PyPI.

-
    version: 1.6
    notes: >

        ``entities()`` API added. A slightly different import mechanism is used.

        The ``numeric_entities(text)`` and ``hex_entities(text)`` APIs have been
        added, shifting the module's mission from "named entities" to "general
        purpose entity transformation." Live and learn!

        The ``unescape(text)`` API changes all entities into Unicode characters.
        While long present, is now available for easy external consumption. It has an
        alias, ``unicode_entities(text)`` for parallelism with the other APIs.

        Repackaged first as a Python package, rather than independent modules. Then,
        given my growing confidence in managing cross-version packages, previously
        separate backend implementations for Python 2 and Python 3 have been merged
        into a single backend.

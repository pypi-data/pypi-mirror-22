        This text describes how our organization is meeting the requirements for the
        Audit policy, and also references a more complete description at ./AU_policy/README.md

        Since the AU-1 `control` is to document and disseminate a policy on Audit and Accountability, then
        this narrative suffices to provide that control. A verification step could be something
        that checks that the referenced policy is no more than 365 days old.

        Application and Server logs are sent to PaperTrail to provide audit
        reduction and report generation capabilites for Freedonia Devops and end users
        of the Freedonia hello_world system.

        can structure and customize audit logs queries to specific app instances, API

        other criteria.

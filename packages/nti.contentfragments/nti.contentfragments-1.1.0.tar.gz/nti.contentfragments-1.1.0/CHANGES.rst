 Changes
=========

1.1.0 (2017-06-14)
==================

- Remove dependency of ``dolmen.builtins``. The interfaces
  ``IUnicode``, ``IBytes`` and ``IString`` are now always defined by this package.

- Add support for Python 3.6.


1.0.0 (2016-08-19)
==================

- Add support for Python 3.
- Stop configuring plone.i18n. It's a big dependency and doesn't work
  on Python 3.
- Introduce our own interfaces for IUnicode and IString, subclassing
  dolmen.builtins.IUnicode and IString, respectively, if possible.
- The word lists used in censoring are cached in memory.
- :class:`nti.contentfragments.html._Serializer` has been renamed and
  is no longer public.
- Depend on zope.mimetype >= 2.1.0 for better support of Python 3.

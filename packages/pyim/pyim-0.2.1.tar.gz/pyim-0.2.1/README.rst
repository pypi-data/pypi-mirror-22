PyIM (Python Insertional Mutagenesis) is a python package for analyzing
insertional mutagenesis data from targeted sequencing of transposon insertion
sites. The package provides several command line tools for identifying
insertions, calling common insertion sites (CISs) and annotating
insertions/CISs directly from the command line. It also aims to provides
the basic building blocks for implementing new pipelines, CIS callers, etc.

# Skill Search

The example skill showcases how to use the alexafsm library to create an interactive search 
experience on Alexa devices. To get the sample skill running, you will need to:

 - Replace `es_server` in [skill_settings.py](./skill_settings.py) with the actual ES server address
 - Replace `INDEX` in [skill.py](skill.py) with the right index name on the ES server
 - Set the `VOICELABS_API_KEY` environment variable to be the API key provided to you by Voicelabs

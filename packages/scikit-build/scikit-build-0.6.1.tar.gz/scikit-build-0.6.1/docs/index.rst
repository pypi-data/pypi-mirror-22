Welcome to scikit-build
=======================

**scikit-build** is an improved build system generator for CPython C
extensions. It provides better support for additional compilers, build
systems, cross compilation, and locating dependencies and their associated
build requirements.

The **scikit-build** package is fundamentally just glue between
the `setuptools` Python module and `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_. Currently,
the package is available to perform builds in a `setup.py` file. In the
future, the project aims to be a build tool option in the `currently
developing pyproject.toml build system specification
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/>`_.

DAta Pipeline and Stack (DAPS)
==============================

A toolbox to generate random data and create a stack state for the data based on grammars specified
by lex and yacc files.

Detailed instructions and usage exist in the files themselves as well.

----

This is the README file for the project.

Authors: Rice DSP - Joshua Michalenko, ameeshshah

4 files exist in this package: Two are used for the random data generation process
(createYAMLFromYacc, generateDataFromYAML) and two are used for creating the stack state
based on that data (makeStates.sh and its subprocess, processStackOutput.py).

Please direct any questions to jjm7@rice.edu or ars7@rice.edu.

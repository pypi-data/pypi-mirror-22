Resolwe SDK for Python supports interaction with Resolwe_ server
and its extension `Resolwe Bioinformatics`_. You can use it to upload
and inspect biomedical data sets, contribute annotations, run
analysis, and write pipelines.

Install from PyPI::

  pip install resdk

If you would like to contribute to the SDK codebase, follow the
`installation steps for developers`_.

.. _installation steps for developers: http://resdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html

Quick Start
===========

In this showcase we will download the aligned reads and their
index (BAM and BAI) from the server:

.. code-block:: python

   import resdk

   # Create a Resolwe object to interact with the server
   res = resdk.Resolwe('admin', 'admin', 'https://torta.bcm.genialis.com')

   # Print command details to stdout
   resdk.start_logging()

   # Get sample meta-data from the server
   sample = res.sample.get('human-example-chr22')

   # Download files associated with the sample
   sample.download()

Both files (BAM and BAI) have downloaded to the working directory.
Check them out. To learn more about the Resolwe SDK continue with
`Getting started`_.

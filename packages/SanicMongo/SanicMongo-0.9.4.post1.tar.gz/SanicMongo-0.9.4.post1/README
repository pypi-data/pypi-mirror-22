SanicMongo is a simple-to-use, declarative-style, document-object mapper
that puts together the nice `MongoEngine <http://mongoengine.org/>`_ API
and the clever `Motor <http://motor.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`_ asynchronous
approuch to create a awesome library for asynchronous access to MongoDB
using python 3.5+.

This is almost a clone of `MongoMotor <ttps://gitlab.com/mongomotor/mongomotor/>`_ with no Tornado dependency.

Take a look at the
`full documentation <http://mongomotor.poraodojuca.net/>`_.

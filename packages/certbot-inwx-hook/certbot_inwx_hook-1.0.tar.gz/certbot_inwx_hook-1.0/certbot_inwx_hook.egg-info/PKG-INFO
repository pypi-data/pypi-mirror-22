Description: certbot INWX hook
        =================
        
        A hook to be used with the ``--manual`` option of the ``certonly``
        subcommand of certbot. The hooks work with the API of
        `INWX <https://inwx.com>`__ and the ``dns-01`` challenge of `Let's
        encrypt <https://lets-encrypt.org>`__.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        This package installs the ``certbot_inwx_deploy`` and
        ``certbot_inwx_cleanup`` entry points. Just supply these to the
        ``--manual-auth-hook`` and ``--manual-cleanup-hook`` of certbot.
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        The configuration file is stored under ``/etc/certbot_inwx_hook.ini``.
        You can set the ``$CERTBOT_INWX_HOOK_CONFIG_FILE`` environment variable
        to a custom location, which will take precedence over the default
        location if set. In the config file you have to supply your login
        information. Optionally you can set additioanl nameserver IPs to check
        for successful propagation of the challenge. You would want ot provide
        the IPs of your registrar here to speed things up.

<h3>About WaveGliDA </h3>
This software package processes raw Iridium output from the CSIR / STS CO<sub>2</sub> instrument into a readable table format. The instrument uses an equilibrator approach to measure CO<sub>2</sub> with a LICOR-820.

<h3>CO<sub>2</sub> calculations</h3>
The CSIR/STS CO<sub>2</sub> instrument returns the mole fraction of carbon dioxide (xCO<sub>2</sub>) as given by the LICOR-820 instrument. xCO<sub>2</sub> is used to calculate parital pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> and fugacity CO<sub>2</sub> with the equations shown below. The methods presented below are in the <code>./backend/calculations.py</code> file.

$$ p\mbox{CO}_2^{sst} = x\mbox{CO}_2 \times P_c \times \exp(0.0423 \cdot \Delta T) $$

where $\Delta T$ is the difference between the equilibrator and sea surface temperatures. This empirical exponential relationship is as defined by <em>Takahashi et al. (1993)</em>. Note that $\Delta T$ is considered 0 K for Wave Glider installations of the instrument, <em>i.e.</em> the equilibrator and sea surface temperatures are exactly the same. $P_{atm}$ is measured atmospheric pressure corrected for the partial pressure of H<sub>2</sub>O.

$$P_c = (P_{atm} - P_{H_2O})$$

where $P_{H_2O}$ is calculated from salinity and temperature according to <em>Weiss and Price (1980)</em>. This is done for both marine and atmospheric measurements of CO<sub>2</sub>.
<br>
<br>
The fugacity of CO<sub>2</sub> is a correction for the non-ideal behaviour of CO<sub>2</sub>. This is done by calculating the vireal expansion as shown below:

$$ f\mbox{CO}_2^{sst} = p\mbox{CO}_2 \times \frac{P_{atm}}{k_B T} $$

where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. This expression is equivalent to the expansion
$$ \rho + B_2(T)\rho^2 + B_3(T)\rho^3 + ... , $$

where $\rho$ is the density of CO<sub>2</sub>

Description: Spotify2MusicBrainz
        ===================
        
        An aid to add information from Spotify to MusicBrainz_.
        
        .. _MusicBrainz: https://musicbrainz.org/
        
        Motivation
        ----------
        
        Spotify has a lot of music. Like, a lot a lot. But due to Spotify's
        interface, it can be a bit clunky to use userscripts on the web site,
        and there's no way to hook into the desktop or mobile app interfaces.
        
        The script uses the API and command-line interface to hopefully make it
        a bit easier to copy information from Spotify into the MusicBrainz
        database, while also including information that isn't actually being
        shown in any of the public phasing Spotify interfaces (such as
        bar codes).
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Spotify2MusicBrainz can be installed using ``pip`` on most platforms, like so::
        
          pip install spotify2musicbrainz
          spotify2musicbrainz
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        There are currently no tests. :(
        
        Contributing
        ------------
        
        The project is still in its very early stages. Feel free to submit PRs,
        but please adhere to code style and respect that not all the project
        goals have been fully fleshed out yet, so your patch may not be in line
        with the author's vision.
        
        Code style
        ^^^^^^^^^^
        
        The script will have a strict adherence to PEP8_, with the exception of
        the line length. It is nice to stay under the 72/79 characters per line,
        but not an absolute necessity.

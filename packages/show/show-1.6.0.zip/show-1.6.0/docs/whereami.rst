Where Am I?
===========

In addition to the ``where`` parameter that may be turned on for each
``show`` call (or in general), there is a method::

    show.where()

intended to display a "flag" or indicator in output where particular
debugging output originated. You may not want location on all the time,
but an occasional oriented signpost can help.

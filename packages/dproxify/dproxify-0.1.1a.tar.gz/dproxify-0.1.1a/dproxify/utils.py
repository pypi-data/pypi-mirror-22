    Daemonizes a procedure. The forked daemon
    is detached and its PID is write to the path
    provided with pidfile.

    Arguments:

    pidfile -- the file path in which to store daemon PID.

    Keywords arguments:

    newfds -- A tuple of three file descriptors which represent
              the new stdin, stdout and stderr (in order).
              All three defaults to 'None', meaning stdin, stdout
              and stderr all points to /dev/null

    procedure -- The procedure to execute.

    args -- Arguments of the procedure.

    shutdown -- The procedure to execute at shutdown.

    shutargs -- Arguments of the shutdown procedure.

    ignored_sigs -- signals to ignore. NOTE: SIGINT and SITERM
                    are alredy handled for the purpose of exiting "gracefully".

    [HOW IT WORKS]

    Every signal should have single or none driver
    -> (no conflict resolving is needed (is already done by synthesizer))

    Every signal is initialized at start with its default value
    -> (no drove, constant drove solved)

    Every assignment has it's delay, clock dependent assignments has delay != 0
    (they should be marked before sim started)
    -> (memories and register solved)

    Every signal value changing object (assignment, index...) should on simEval() yield
       tuple (updateDelayTime, applicator) where applicator is function(oldValue)
       and returns tuple (newValue, valueHasChangedFlag)
    -> (updating value in arrays, structs etc. solved)

    Every interprocess signal is marked by synthesizer and it can not be directly updated
       by any process, process should only return tuple (updateDelayTime, applicator)
       and let simulator to update it for others, any other signals are evaluated as expression
       by every process
    every process drives only one signal
    every process uses sensitivity-list like in other languages (but it is generated automatically)
    -> (communication between process solved)

    Hdl processes can not contain any wait statements etc. only simulation processes can.
    Simulation processes are written in python.
    -> (using hdl as main simulator driver is not efficient and thats why it is not supported
        and it is easy to just read hdl process with unsupported statements and translate them to
        simulator commands)

    HWprocesses have smaller priority than simulation processes
    this allows simplyfi logic of all agents
    when simulation process is executed HW part did not anything in this time
    so simulation process can prepare anythink for HW part (= can write)
    if simulation process need to read it has to yield simulator.updateComplete
    first, process then be waken after reaction of HW in this time
    -> agents are greatly simplified, they just need to yield simulator.updateComplete
       before read
       Do not read before write in single time (potential combinational loop), because
       of event dependent HW processes will not be reevalueated

    This simulation is made to check if hsl code behaves the same way as hdl.
    It has some limitations from HDL point of view but every single one can be rewritten to supported format.
    Hdl synthesizer of HWToolkit does it automatically.

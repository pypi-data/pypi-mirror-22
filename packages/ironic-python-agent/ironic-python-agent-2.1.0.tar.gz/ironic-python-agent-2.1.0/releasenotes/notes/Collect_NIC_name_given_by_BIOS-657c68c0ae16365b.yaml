features:
  - Adds an extra field ``biosdevname`` (BIOS given NICs name) to network
    interface inventory collected by ``default`` collector of
    ironic-python-agent. Biosdevname utility is used for collecting bios given
    NICs name.

issues:
  - Collecting the 'biosdevname' field on network interfaces is impossible on any
    Debian-based images due to the missing 'biosdevname' utility. This includes
    the CoreOS image, as the CoreOS image utilizes a Debian-based chroot.

Description: notes-pico
        ==========
        
        Notes Pico is a simple note-taking web application. It was originally
        written by Charles Leifer as a demo of how to write a simple, but slick
        web application using the Flask web micro-framework. The application is
        described in the blog post
        http://charlesleifer.com/blog/saturday-morning-hack-a-little-note-taking-app-with-flask/
        . Notes Pico is a port of this application to Picoweb web pico-framework
        for MicroPython. It was ported by Paul Sokolovsky.
        
        To install and run the application, you should install MicroPython
        "Unix" port as described at https://github.com/micropython/micropython .
        Once you have ``micropython`` executable in your PATH (recommended, but
        not strictly necessary), change directory to where you want to install
        the app (``~/tmp/`` should be good for a quick test) and install
        ``notes-pico`` package::
        
            micropython -m upip install -p app notes-pico
        
        ``app`` (argument of ``-p`` option) is a subdirectory into which to
        install the application. To run the app, execute::
        
            MICROPYPATH=app micropython -m notes_pico
        
        This will initialize note storage and output a URL to open in a browser::
        
            * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8081/
        
        Open the link and start adding notes (after typing text press "Add note"
        button or press Ctrl+Enter). Note that Picoweb port is intended to be
        simple and low-resource, so supports only plain-text notes, unlike the
        original Flask application.
        
        
        Storage backends
        ----------------
        
        Notes Pico supports 3 storage backends:
        
        * BTree
        * Filesystem
        * SQLite3
        
        As a first step towards portability to MicroPython microcontroller
        versions, the default backend for the package installed from PyPI
        via the commands in the previous section is BTree database. The
        notes are stored in ``notes.db`` database file of the current
        directory, in BerkeleyDB 1.x format.
        
        If you would like to try filesystem/SQLite3 backend, you'll need to
        checkout https://github.com/pfalcon/notes-pico and edit file
        ``notes_pico/config.py``. The repository has a convenience
        Makefile to install dependencies and run the application, similar
        to the effect achieved by the commands above.
        
        
        Known issues and limitations
        ----------------------------
        
        As mentioned above, Picoweb port of the application supports only
        plain-text notes, no formatting, images or videos.
        
        Currently, Notes Pico tested only with "Unix" MicroPython port,
        though there's intention to make it work on microcontroller ports
        with networking support and suitable resources.

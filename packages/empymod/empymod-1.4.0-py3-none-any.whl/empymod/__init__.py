Installation & requirements
---------------------------

The easiest way to install the latest stable version of `empymod` is via
`conda`:

.. code-block:: console

   > conda install -c prisae empymod

or via `pip`:

.. code-block:: console

   > pip install empymod

Alternatively, you can download the latest version from GitHub and either add
the path to `empymod` to your python-path variable, or install it in your
python distribution via:

.. code-block:: console

   > python setup.py install

Required are python version 3.4 or higher and the modules `NumPy` and `SciPy`.
If you want to run parts of the kernel in parallel, the module `numexpr` is
required additionally.

**Note**: Do not use `scipy == 0.19.0`. It has a memory leak in `quad`, see
`github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/7216 <https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/7216>`_.
So if you use QUAD (or potentially QWE) in any of your transforms you might see
your memory usage going through the roof.


If you are new to Python I recommend using a Python distribution, which will
ensure that all dependencies are met, specifically properly compiled versions
of `NumPy` and `SciPy`; I recommend using Anaconda (version 3.x;
`continuum.io/downloads <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_).  If you
install Anaconda you can simply start the *Anaconda Navigator*, add the channel
`prisae` and `empymod` will appear in the package list and can be installed
with a click.


Usage
'''''

The main modelling routines is `bipole`, which can calculate the
electromagnetic frequency- or time-domain field due to arbitrary finite
electric or magnetic bipole sources, measured by arbitrary finite electric or
magnetic bipole receivers. The model is defined by horizontal resistivity and
anisotropy, horizontal and vertical electric permittivities and horizontal and
vertical magnetic permeabilities. By default, the electromagnetic response is
normalized to source and receiver of 1 m length, and source strength of 1 A.

A simple frequency-domain example, with most of the parameters left at the
default value:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from empymod import bipole
    >>> # x-directed bipole source: x0, x1, y0, y1, z0, z1
    >>> src = [-50, 50, 0, 0, 100, 100]
    >>> # x-directed dipole source-array: x, y, z, azimuth, dip
    >>> rec = [np.arange(1, 11)*500, np.zeros(10), 200, 0, 0]
    >>> # layer boundaries
    >>> depth = [0, 300, 1000, 1050]
    >>> # layer resistivities
    >>> res = [1e20, .3, 1, 50, 1]
    >>> # Frequency
    >>> freq = 1
    >>> # Calculate electric field due to an electric source at 1 Hz.
    >>> # [msrc = mrec = True (default)]

Note on speed, memory, and accuracy
-----------------------------------
There is the usual trade-off between speed, memory, and accuracy. Very
generally speaking we can say that the *FHT* is faster than *QWE*, but *QWE* is
much easier on memory usage. *QWE* allows you to control the accuracy. A
standard quadrature in the form of *QUAD* is also provided. *QUAD* is generally
orders of magnitudes slower, and more fragile depending on the input arguments.
However, it can provide accurate results where *FHT* and *QWE* fail.

There are two optimisation possibilities included via the ``opt``-flag:
parallelisation (``opt='parallel'``) and spline interpolation
(``opt='spline'``).  They are switched off by default. The optimization
``opt='parallel'`` only affects speed and memory usage, whereas
``opt='spline'`` also affects precision!

I am sure `empymod` could be made much faster with cleverer coding style or
with the likes of `cython` or `numba`. Suggestions and contributions are
welcomed!


Included transforms
'''''''''''''''''''

**Hankel transform**:

    - Fast Hankel Transform *FHT* ([Gosh_1971]_)
    - Quadrature with Extrapolation *QWE* ([Key_2012]_)
    - Adaptive quadrature *QUAD* (from `QUADPACK`)

**Fourier transform**:

    - Sine- and Cosine filters ([Anderson_1975]_)
    - Quadrature with Extrapolation *QWE* ([Key_2012]_)
    - Fast Fourier Transform *FFT*
    - Logarithmic Fast Fourier Transform *FFTLog* ([Hamilton_2000]_)


FFTLog
......

FFTLog is the logarithmic analogue to the Fast Fourier Transform FFT originally
proposed by [Talman_1978]_. The code used by `empymod` was published in
Appendix B of [Hamilton_2000]_ and is publicly available at
`casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/FFTLog <http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/FFTLog>`_.
From the `FFTLog`-website:

*FFTLog is a set of fortran subroutines that compute the fast Fourier or Hankel
(= Fourier-Bessel) transform of a periodic sequence of logarithmically spaced
points.*

FFTlog can be used for the Hankel as well as for the Fourier Transform, but
currently `empymod` uses it only for the Fourier transform. It uses a
simplified version of the python implementation of FFTLog, `pyfftlog`
(`github.com/prisae/pyfftlog <https://github.com/prisae/pyfftlog>`_).



Depths, Rotation, and Bipole
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
**Depths**: Calculation of many source and receiver positions is fastest if
they remain at the same depth, as they can be calculated in one kernel-call. If
depths do change, one has to loop over them. Note: Sources or receivers placed
on a layer interface are considered in the upper layer.

**Rotation**: Sources and receivers aligned along the principal axes x, y, and
z can be calculated in one kernel call. For arbitrary oriented di- or bipoles,
3 kernel calls are required. If source and receiver are arbitrary oriented,
9 (3x3) kernel calls are required.

**Bipole**: Bipoles increase the calculation time by the amount of integration
points used. For a source and a receiver bipole with each 5 integration points
you need 25 (5x5) kernel calls. You can calculate it in 1 kernel call if you
set both integration points to 1, and therefore calculate the bipole as if they
were dipoles at their centre.

**Example**: For 1 source and 10 receivers, all at the same depth, 1 kernel
call is required.  If all receivers are at different depths, 10 kernel calls
are required. If you make source and receivers bipoles with 5 integration
points, 250 kernel calls are required.  If you rotate the source arbitrary
horizontally, 500 kernel calls are required. If you rotate the receivers too,
in the horizontal plane, 1'000 kernel calls are required. If you rotate the
receivers also vertically, 1'500 kernel calls are required. If you rotate the
source vertically too, 2'250 kernel calls are required. So your calculation
will take 2'250 times longer! No matter how fast the kernel is, this will take
a long time. Therefore carefully plan how precise you want to define your
source and receiver bipoles.

           many frequencies).

Parallelisation
'''''''''''''''
If ``opt = 'parallel'``, a good dozen of the most time-consuming statements are
calculated by using the `numexpr` package
(https://github.com/pydata/numexpr/wiki/Numexpr-Users-Guide).  These statements
are all in the `kernel`-functions `greenfct`, `reflections`, and `fields`, and
all involve :math:`\Gamma` in one way or another, often calculating square
roots or exponentials. As :math:`\Gamma` has dimensions (#frequencies,
#offsets, #layers, #lambdas), it can become fairly big.

The module `numexpr` uses by default all available cores up to a maximum of 8.
You can change this behaviour to a lower or a higher value with the following
command (in the example it is changed to 4):

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import numexpr
    >>> numexpr.set_num_threads(4)

This parallelisation will make `empymod` faster if you calculate a lot of
offsets/frequencies at once, but slower for few offsets/frequencies. Best
practice is to check first which one is faster. (You can use the
benchmark-notebook in the `empymod/example-notebooks
<https://github.com/empymod/example-notebooks>`_-repository.)

Spline interpolation
''''''''''''''''''''
If ``opt = 'spline'``, the so-called *lagged convolution* or *splined* variant
of the *FHT* (depending on ``htarg``) or the *splined* version of the *QWE* are
applied. The spline option should be used with caution, as it is an
interpolation and therefore less precise than the non-spline version. However,
it significantly speeds up *QWE*, and massively speeds up *FHT*. (The
`numexpr`-version of the spline option is slower than the pure spline one, and
therefore it is only possible to have either ``'parallel'`` or ``'spline'``
on.)

Setting ``opt = 'spline'`` is generally faster. Good speed-up is achieved for
*QWE* by setting ``maxint`` as low as possible. Also, the higher ``nquad`` is,
the higher the speed-up will be.  The variable ``pts_per_dec`` has also some
influence. For *FHT*, big improvements are achieved for long FHT-filters and
for many offsets/frequencies (thousands).  Additionally, spline minimizes
memory requirements a lot.  Speed-up is greater if all source-receiver angles
are identical.

*FHT*: Default for ``pts_per_dec = None``, which is the original *lagged
convolution*, where the spacing is defined by the filter-base, the transform is
carried out first followed by spline-interpolation. You can set this parameter
to an integer, which defines the number of points to evaluate per decade. In
this case the spline-interpolation is carried out first, followed by the
transformation. The original *lagged convolution* is generally the fastest for
a very good precision. However, by setting ``pts_per_dec`` appropriately one
can achieve higher precision, normally at the cost of speed.

.. warning::

    Keep in mind that it uses interpolation, and is therefore not as
    accurate as the non-spline version.  Use with caution and always compare
    with the non-spline version if you can apply the spline-version to your
    problem at hand!

Be aware that *QUAD* (Hankel transform) *always* use the splined version and
*always* loop over offsets. The same applies for all frequency-to-time
transformations.

The splined versions of *QWE* check whether the ratio of any two adjacent
intervals is above a certain threshold (steep end of the wavenumber or
frequency spectrum). If it is, it carries out *QUAD* for this interval instead
of *QWE*. The threshold is stored in `diff_quad`, which can be changed within
the parameter `htarg` and `ftarg`.


Looping
'''''''
By default, you can calculate many offsets and many frequencies all in one go,
vectorized (for the *FHT*), which is the default. The ``loop`` parameter gives
you the possibility to force looping over frequencies or offsets. This
parameter can have severe effects on both runtime and memory usage. Play around
with this factor to find the fastest version for your problem at hand. It
ALWAYS loops over frequencies if ``ht = 'QWE'/'QUAD'`` or if ``opt =
'spline'``.  All vectorized is very fast if there are few offsets or few
frequencies. If there are many offsets and many frequencies, looping over the
smaller of the two will be faster. Choosing the right looping together with
``opt = 'parallel'`` can have a huge influence.

Vertical components
'''''''''''''''''''
It is advised to use ``xdirect = True`` (the default) if source and receiver
are in the same layer to calculate

    - the vertical electric field due to a vertical electric source,
    - configurations that involve vertical magnetic components (source or
      receiver),
    - all configurations when source and receiver depth are exactly the same.

The Hankel transforms methods are having sometimes difficulties transforming
these functions.

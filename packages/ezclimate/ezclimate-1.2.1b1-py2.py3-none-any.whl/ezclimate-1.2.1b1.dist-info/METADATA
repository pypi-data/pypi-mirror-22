EZ-Climate
==========

EZ-Climate is a model for pricing carbon dioxide emission. It explores
the implications of these richer preference specifications for the
optimal carbon dioxide price. We develop the EZ-Climate model, a simple
discrete-time model in which the representative agent has an Epstein-Zin
preference specification, and in which uncertainty about the effect of
carbon dioxide emissions on global temperature and on eventual damages
is gradually resolved over time. In the EZ-Climate model the optimal
price is equal to the price of one ton of carbon dioxide emitted at any
given point in time that maximizes the utility of the representative
agent at that time. We embed a number of features including tail risk,
the potential for technological change, and backstop technologies. In
contrast to most modeled carbon price paths, the EZ-Climate model
suggests a high optimal carbon price today that is expected to decline
over time. It also points to the importance of backstop technologies and
to potentially very large.

Documentation
-------------

See the `EZ-Climate User's
Guide <https://oscarsjogren.github.io/dlw/>`__ for EZ-Climate
documentation.

In order to get the tip documentation, change directory to the ``doc``
subfolder and type in ``make html``, the documentation will be under
``../../ez_climate_docs/html``. You will need
`Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`__ to build the documentation.

Installation
------------

We encourage you to use pip to install ezclimate on your system.

.. code:: bash

    pip install ezclimate

If you wish to build from sources, download or clone the repository.

.. code:: bash

    python setup.py install

Requirements
------------

EZ-Climate is compatible with Python 2 and 3.
`Numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`__ is required, and we recommend
`matplotlib <http://www.matplotlib.org/>`__ for visualization of
results.

Description: Internet-Draft text to XML Conversion Tool
        ==========================================
        
        This tool, 'id2xml', is intended for use by the RFC-Editor staff, in order to
        produce a first xml2rfc-compatible XML version from text-only Internet-Draft
        submissions.
        
        id2xml may also be useful for Internet-Draft authors who wish to start working
        on a new version of an older draft or RFC, for which no xml2rfc-compatible XML
        source is available.
        
        The releases of the 0.9.x release series are preview releases, with a number
        of known deficiencies.  They are released in order that potential users may
        provide feedback on the most desired improvements ahead of a 1.0.0 release.
        
        Version 0.9.0 can process the drafts specified in the development Statement of
        Work to XML files acceptable to xml2rfc, and can also process a number of
        other test files to acceptable XML.  However, adding new drafts to the test
        set still reveals weaknesses in many cases, so trouble-free processing of any
        arbitrary draft should not be expected from the 0.9.x series.
        
        The XML produced follows RFC 7749 [1]_ in version 0.9.x and 1.x of the tool, and
        will follow RFC 7991 [2]_ in version 2.x, which will be released once support
        is available to process XML sources which follows the RFC 7991 vocabulary.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        Version 1.0.0rc3 (26 May 2017)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          This release reduces the diff between the text input file and the
          text file resulting from the generated xml even more.  The average
          number of lines in the input which is rendered differently in the
          output is now below 3%.
        
          From the changelog:
        
          * Committed updated (smaller) diff files for test baseline
        
          * Added more alternatives to the code recognition regex, for xml tags and
            C statements
        
          * Refined the header/footer stripping a bit, to not join text broken across
            pages into one paragraph when there are too many intervening blank lines, 
            or when the last line is a table or figure label.
        
          * Added handling of blank lines in list items, by inserting <vspace> as
            needed
        
          * Added isertion of subcompact PIs for compact list.  Fixed some warning 
            message issues.
        
          * Added another comment delimiter to the code regex, and applied it to
            whole text blocks, not only to their first line.
        
          * Moved list block normalisation functions into the DraftParser class, and
            added recognition of compact lists.  Also some refactoring.
        
          * Added more descriptive manpage text, and tweaked the making of the
            manpage.
        
          * Added switches for trace start and stop on line number, and renamed the
            trace-related switches.
        
          * Refined guess_list_style().
        
          * Added code to recognise 'centered' titles when they span the whole line
        
          * Rewrote the code which parses the top left column of the titlepage to not
            assume any ordering of the lines, but permit them to occur in almost any
            order.  The only exception is that if there's a working group string, it
            must occur first, as it has no recognizable keyword to identify it.
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 1.0.0rc2 (22 May 2017)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Tweaked the help text and the manpage generation.
        
          * Updated MANIFEST and Makefile
        
          * Added some missing files, updated the acceptable diffs in test/ok/.

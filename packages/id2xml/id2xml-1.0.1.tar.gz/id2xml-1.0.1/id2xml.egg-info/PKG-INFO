Description: Internet-Draft text to XML Conversion Tool
        ==========================================
        
        This tool, 'id2xml', is intended for use by the RFC-Editor staff, in order to
        produce a first xml2rfc-compatible XML version from text-only Internet-Draft
        submissions.
        
        id2xml may also be useful for Internet-Draft authors who wish to start working
        on a new version of an older draft or RFC, for which no xml2rfc-compatible XML
        source is available.
        
        The releases of the 0.9.x release series are preview releases, with a number
        of known deficiencies.  They are released in order that potential users may
        provide feedback on the most desired improvements ahead of a 1.0.0 release.
        
        Version 0.9.0 can process the drafts specified in the development Statement of
        Work to XML files acceptable to xml2rfc, and can also process a number of
        other test files to acceptable XML.  However, adding new drafts to the test
        set still reveals weaknesses in many cases, so trouble-free processing of any
        arbitrary draft should not be expected from the 0.9.x series.
        
        The XML produced follows RFC 7749 [1]_ in version 0.9.x and 1.x of the tool, and
        will follow RFC 7991 [2]_ in version 2.x, which will be released once support
        is available to process XML sources which follows the RFC 7991 vocabulary.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        Version 1.0.1 (14 Jun 2017)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          This is a bugfix release which addressess a number of issues raised by the
          RFC Editor staff, and a few issues found during testing.
        
          * Added generation of a sortrefs PI which matches the original's RFC
            references being sorted or not.
        
          * Tweaked the slugifier, and applied it to section-* anchors, to ensure 
            they are valid.  Fixed an issue causing trailing commas in entity names.
        
          * Rewrote the handling of back matter to permit the various back sections 
            to occur in any order.  Added yet another way to say 'work in progress' in 
            references; added new reference patterns and removed the expectation that 
            references will have a terminating period; did some minor code clean-up.
        
          * Refined the header and footer stripping to consider end-of-line commas,
            and to require short lines triggering paragraph breaks to contain text.
        
          * Fixed a bug in line reading, which could cause the first line of a 
            document to be skipped.  Added recognition of additional Standards Track 
            status indications, such as 'Proposed Standard', etc.  Fixed a grammar 
            issue.  Fixed an issue with mismatched authors on the first page and 
            Author's Addresses section.  Refined the header/footer stripping to deal 
            with additional variations of header/footer lines.
        
          * Fixed a number of places where warn() was called with a line object was 
            used instead of the line number.
        
          * Changed to using the supplied figure or texttable label to set the 
            title attribute also when rendering the figure as texttable or texttable as 
            figure.
        
          * Refined the tokenizer for the text parser in order to correctly handle 
            things like (Section N.N).
        
          * Eliminated trailing blank cells in texttables.
        
          * Added RFC-Editor staff to the release notification list.
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 1.0.0 (30 May 2017)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          The number of lines in the corpus of test documents now show a percentage
          of lines which differ from the original input file to the text file generated
          from id2xml's xml file of just over 2%, and in some cases the generated
          text is an improvement over the original text.  The tool should now be
          functionally complete for vocabulary v2 output, so this seems like a good
          time for a 1.0.0 release.
        
          Changes since 1.0.0rc3:
        
          * Split the functionality up into separate run.py, parser.py and utils.py
            files, and adjusted Makefile and MANIFEST accordingly.
        
          * Entries in the <references/> sections are now entity references for drafts
            and RFCs, instead of inserting the reference xml as generated from the
            input document.
        
          * There's a slight refactoring of how the reference_anchors and
            section_anchors lists are generated.
        
          * Added xref elements for Section N.nn strings which reference document
            sections.
        
          * There has been multiple rounds of refactoring, to clean up and organise
            the code better.
        
          * The generated xml has also been cleaned up, to avoid long lines and
            tags bunched up on the same line.  It's still not super pretty, but
            should be readable.
        
          * Added a check on coupled debug trace switches, where setting a trace start
            option also requires that a trace stop option be set.
        
          * The regular expression which identifies code has been further refined.
        
          * Refined the header stripping to not join pararaphs where the first part
            has a short line.
        
          * Added more cases where list hangIndent is derived and set.
        
          * Added modification of the text-list-symbols PI in order to better match
            the source.  Since this is a global setting, it can't handle inconsistent
            bullet styles in a document (for instance created with hangText="*" ...).
        
          * Improved the error message for missing stream information when attempting
            to process older RFCs
        
          * Fixed a bug in the handling of the xml tree for xrefs found in text
            interspersed with vspace elements.
        
          * Code optimisations.
        
          * Added the last two changelog sections to the release information shown onl
            PyPi.

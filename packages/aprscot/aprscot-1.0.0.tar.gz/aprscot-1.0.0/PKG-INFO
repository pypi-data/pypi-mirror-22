Description: aprscot - APRS Cursor-on-Target Gateway.
        ****************************************
        
        aprscot receives APRS Frames from APRS-IS and outputs them in Cursor-on-Target
        XML Formatted events, for use with COT systems such as RaptorX, Falconview, etc.
        
        Currently only supports APRS-IS and Location-type APRS messages, and only sending
        to UDP COT Hosts.
        
        More features and capabilities TK, let me know what you're looking to build!
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        The following example forwards all APRS Frames within 100 meters of W2GMD-9's last known
        location to the Cursor-on-Target host at 10.1.0.1 port 18999 (UDP)::
        
            aprscot -c W2GMD-9 -p xxx -C 10.1.0.1:18999 -f m/100
        
        
        Example Cursor-on-Target Event
        ==============================
        
        Here's what a COT message from aprscot looks like::
        
            <?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes" ?>
            <event version="1.0" type="a-f-G-E-V-C" uid="APRS.W2GMD-15"
                   time="2017-05-24T20:53:23.059489Z" how="h-e">
              <point lat="37.693" lon="-121.72716" hae="10" ce="10" le="10" />
            </event>

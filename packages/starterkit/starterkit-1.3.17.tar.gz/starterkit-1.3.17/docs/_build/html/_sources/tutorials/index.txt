publishing maps. The tutorials are written in a workshop like format
and are broken into two groups *Users* and *Administrators*.

:ref:`users`

:ref:`admin`
	The administrator workshop will guide you through the installation and configuration of GET-IT, as well as explore further possibilities with GET-IT.

**Welcome to mimiron!**

> [Mimiron](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=33350/mimiron) is one of the Titanic Watchers. He once resided at the Temple of Invention, but is absent during the time of Loken's rebellion.

Mimiron is a CLI tool that aims provide a better workflow when manging Terraform variables.

When all of your Terraform config is completely modular, the only sane way to manage variables is to store them inside a `variables.json` file and pass that along when you run `terraform apply -var-file=variables.json`... but where do you store `variables.json` and how can you easily make changes?

Our approach is to store non-sensitive variables inside the same repository as our Terraform config. Sensitive variables like your AWS secret and master db password are stored elsewhere and pulled in via environment variables e.g. `TF_VAR_aws_access_key`. Mimiron does **not** manage sensitive variables for you.

We want to make simple tasks such as bumping an image version simple and Mimiron is a small CLI tool that does that. Mimiron provides a few commands to help automate the cumbersome tasks away.

## Installation

```
$ pip install mimiron
```

Export necessary environment variables to let Mimiron know where your terraform repo is located:

```bash
# Path to your Terraform configuration
export TF_DEPLOYMENT_PATH="~/workspace/terraform"

# Docker username, password and organisation (or account)
export DOCKER_USERNAME=""
export DOCKER_PASSWORD=""
export DOCKER_ORG=""
```

There are also optional environment variables you can override:

```bash
export DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT=staging
export DEFAULT_GIT_BRANCH=master
```

## Assumptions

* Your Terraform config repo has a dir `/terraform/tfvars/` with your tfvars in a JSON file e.g. `/terraform/tfvars/staging.json`
* Docker image artifacts are stored in the DockerHub registry
* Docker image artifacts are named `service_name_image` e.g. `web_marketing_image`
* AMI artifacts are named `service_name_ami_id` e.g. `web_marketing_ami_id`

## Usage

```
>>> mim --help
mimiron.py

usage:
    mim (bump|b) <service> [--env=<env>] [--latest] [--no-push] [--show-all]
    mim (status|st) [--env=<env>]

commands:
    (bump|b)      bumps the <service> with an image <artifact>
    (status|st)   shows the currently used artifact id for <env>

arguments:
    <artifact>    the deployment artifact we are pushing (e.g. Docker image/AMI)
    <service>     the application we're targeting
    --env=<env>   the environment we want to change [default: staging]
    --show-all    show all artifacts for the current service

options:
    --no-push     make local changes without pushing to remote
    --latest      use the latest artifact when updating a service

    -h --help     shows this
    -v --version  shows version
```

## Development

Clone the project:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:ImageIntelligence/mimiron.git
```

Setup your virtualenv:

```
$ mkvirtualenv mimiron
```

Attach mim to your shell:

```
$ python setup.py develop
```

## Deployment

Create a `~/.pypirc` and replace the username and password with real credentials:

```
[distutils]
index-servers =
  mimiron

[mimiron]
repository=https://pypi.python.org/pypi
username=xxx
password=yyy
```

Register this package to the Cheeseshop:

```
$ python setup.py register -r mimiron
```

Build a distributable and upload:

```
$ python setup.py sdist upload -r mimiron
```

         Changelog
        ===========
        
        2.2 (2017-05-16)
        ================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Add a month list view which looks like the print version of the month view.
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        - Allow to delete a recurred event and put a new event with the same category
          into its place. Before this fix the new event might not be displayed.
        
        
        2.1.1 (2017-04-09)
        ==================
        
        - Fix icons of links introduced in version 2.1 to be rendered equally on
          Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer and Chrome.
        
        
        2.1 (2017-04-08)
        ================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Add links in month view to easily access the previous resp. next month.
        
        - Rename the links to the month view and to the year view and add titles to
          them.
        
        
        Other changes
        -------------
        
        - Bring the test coverage to 100 % including the tests itself and the test
          infrastructure but without the need to run the selenium tests to achieve
          this.
        
        - Update to changes in test infrastructure in `icemac.addressbook >= 4.0`.
        
        
        2.0 (2017-02-04)
        ================
        
        Backward incompatible changes
        -----------------------------
        
        - Update test infrastructure to `icemac.addressbook >= 3.0`, thus update to
          `py.test >= 2.8`. The fixtures which can be reused where moved to
          ``icemac.ab.calendar.fixtures``. ``icemac.ab.calendar.conftest`` should no
          longer be used from foreign packages as this leads to problems with the new
          py.test version.
        
        
        Bugs
        ----
        
        - The computation of Biweekly events was fixed: There are now always two weeks
          between the events. Previously it could only be one if the recurrence in the
          previous month was in the last week of the month.
        
        - Fix the bug with daylight saving time adding one hour to each event during
          DST for the year calendar which was already fixed for the month calendar in
          version 1.8.

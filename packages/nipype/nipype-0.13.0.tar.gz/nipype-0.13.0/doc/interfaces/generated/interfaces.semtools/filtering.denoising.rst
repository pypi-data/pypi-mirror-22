title: Unbiased NLM for MRI

category: Filtering.Denoising

description: This module implements a fast version of the popular Non-Local Means filter for image denoising. This algorithm filters each pixel as a weighted average of its neighbors in a large vicinity. The weights are computed based on the similarity of each neighbor with the voxel to be denoised.
 In the original formulation a patch with a certain radius is centered in each of the voxels, and the Mean Squared Error between each pair of corresponding voxels is computed. In this implementation, only the mean value and gradient components are compared. This, together with an efficient memory management, can attain a speed-up of nearly 20x. Besides, the filtering is more accurate than the original with poor SNR.
 This code is intended for its use with MRI (or any other Rician-distributed modality): the second order moment is estimated, then we subtract twice the squared power of noise, and finally we take the square root of the result to remove the Rician bias.
 The original implementation of the NLM filter may be found in:

Inputs::

        [Mandatory]

        [Optional]
        args: (a unicode string)
                Additional parameters to the command
                flag: %s
        environ: (a dictionary with keys which are a bytes or None or a value
                 of class 'str' and with values which are a bytes or None or a value
                 of class 'str', nipype default value: {})
                Environment variables
        hp: (a float)
                This parameter is related to noise; the larger the parameter, the
                more aggressive the filtering. Should be near 1, and only values
                between 0.8 and 1.2 are allowed
                flag: --hp %f
        ignore_exception: (a boolean, nipype default value: False)
                Print an error message instead of throwing an exception in case the
                interface fails to run
        inputVolume: (an existing file name)
                Input MRI volume.
                flag: %s, position: -2
        outputVolume: (a boolean or a file name)
                Output (filtered) MRI volume.
                flag: %s, position: -1
        ps: (a float)
                To accelerate computations, preselection is used: if the normalized
                difference is above this threshold, the voxel will be discarded (non
                used for average)
                flag: --ps %f
        rc: (a list of items which are an integer (int or long))
                Similarity between blocks is computed as the difference between mean
                values and gradients. These parameters are computed fitting a
                hyperplane with LS inside a neighborhood of this size
                flag: --rc %s
        rs: (a list of items which are an integer (int or long))
                The algorithm search for similar voxels in a neighborhood of this
                radius (radii larger than 5,5,5 are very slow, and the results can
                be only marginally better. Small radii may fail to effectively
                remove the noise).
                flag: --rs %s
        sigma: (a float)
                The root power of noise (sigma) in the complex Gaussian process the
                Rician comes from. If it is underestimated, the algorithm fails to
                remove the noise. If it is overestimated, over-blurring is likely to
                occur.
                flag: --sigma %f
        terminal_output: ('stream' or 'allatonce' or 'file' or 'none')
                Control terminal output: `stream` - displays to terminal immediately
                (default), `allatonce` - waits till command is finished to display
                output, `file` - writes output to file, `none` - output is ignored

Outputs::

        outputVolume: (an existing file name)
                Output (filtered) MRI volume.

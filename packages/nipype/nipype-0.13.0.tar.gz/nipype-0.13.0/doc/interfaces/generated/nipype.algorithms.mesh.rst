ComputeMeshWarp
---------------

`Link to code <http://github.com/nipy/nipype/tree/ec86b7476/nipype/algorithms/mesh.py#L165>`__

Calculates a the vertex-wise warping to get surface2 from surface1.
It also reports the average distance of vertices, using the norm specified
as input.

.. warning:

  A point-to-point correspondence between surfaces is required


Example::

    import nipype.algorithms.mesh as m
    dist = m.ComputeMeshWarp()
    dist.inputs.surface1 = 'surf1.vtk'
    dist.inputs.surface2 = 'surf2.vtk'
    res = dist.run()

Inputs::

        [Mandatory]
        surface1: (an existing file name)
                Reference surface (vtk format) to which compute distance.
        surface2: (an existing file name)
                Test surface (vtk format) from which compute distance.

        [Optional]
        ignore_exception: (a boolean, nipype default value: False)
                Print an error message instead of throwing an exception in case the
                interface fails to run
        metric: ('euclidean' or 'sqeuclidean', nipype default value:
                 euclidean)

        out_warp: (a file name, nipype default value: surfwarp.vtk)
                vtk file based on surface1 and warpings mapping it to surface2

                "none": no weighting is performed, surface": edge distance is
                weighted by the corresponding surface area

Applies a displacement field to a point set given in vtk format.

field computed with :class:`nipype.interfaces.fsl.utils.ConvertWarp`.

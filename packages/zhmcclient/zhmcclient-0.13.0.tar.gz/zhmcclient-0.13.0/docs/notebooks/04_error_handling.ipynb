    "The zhmcclient package defines a number of exceptions to indicate specific error situations at run time. A prominent example is a connection error in the communication with the HMC, or invalid input parameters for an HMC operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The zhmcclient exceptions are all derived from [`zhmcclient.Error`](https://python-zhmcclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general.html#zhmcclient.Error), in order to have a common base exception to catch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The zhmcclient exceptions are provided in order to have a stable definition for users of what can legally go wrong; they do not cover everything that can possibly go wrong. Any exception that is raised by the zhmcclient package that is not derived from `zhmcclient.Error` should be considered a programming error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The zhmcclient exceptions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [`zhmcclient.ConnectionError`](https://python-zhmcclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general.html#zhmcclient.ConnectionError) - indicates a problem with the connection to the HMC, at the transport level or below.\n",
    "* [`zhmcclient.AuthError`](https://python-zhmcclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general.html#zhmcclient.AuthError) - indicates an authentication error with the HMC, either at the TLS/SSL handshake level (e.g. with CA certificates), or at the HTTP level.\n",
    "* [`zhmcclient.HTTPError`](https://python-zhmcclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general.html#zhmcclient.HTTPError) - indicates that the HMC returned an HTTP response with a bad HTTP status code.\n",
    "* [`zhmcclient.ParseError`](https://python-zhmcclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general.html#zhmcclient.ParseError) - indicates a parsing error while processing a response from the HMC.\n",
    "* [`zhmcclient.VersionError`](https://python-zhmcclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general.html#zhmcclient.VersionError) - indicates that there is a version mismatch between the HMC API versions supported by the client and by the HMC.\n",

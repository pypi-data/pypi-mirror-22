Description: Oozie workflow tools AKA Slippin Jimmy
        ======================================
        
        |Build Status|
        
        Generating Oozie workflows can be a tedious task, coding XML is not
        awesome, so you can generate them from Jinja templates using the
        process\_templates.py script.
        
        Installing the module
        ---------------------
        
        ::
        
            # pip install slippinj
        
        Running the script
        ------------------
        
        The arguments not provided and mandatory are asked for during script
        execution:
        
        ::
        
            jimmy -h
        
        Running the tests
        -----------------
        
        Remember to remove the package before running the tests or the installed
        version will be used to run them
        
        ::
        
            $ make test
        
        Components of the module
        ------------------------

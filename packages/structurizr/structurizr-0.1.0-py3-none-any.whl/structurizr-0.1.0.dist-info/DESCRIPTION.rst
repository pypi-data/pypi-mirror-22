It's been said that "software is eating the world", yet software
development teams waste time and money because they struggle to
communicate software architecture. Existing CASE/modelling tools
are complex and have become unfashionable after the "agile"
movement started in 2001. Teams now tend to favour whiteboards
and general purpose tooling instead. The resulting diagrams,
however, are typically ad hoc and confusing, which slows
communication and learning. The diagrams are also disconnected
from the code, which limits their usefulness for architectural
improvement.

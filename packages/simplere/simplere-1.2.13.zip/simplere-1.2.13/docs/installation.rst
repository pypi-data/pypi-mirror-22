Installation
============

To install or upgrade to the latest version::

    pip install -U simplere

To install under a specific Python version (3.3 in this example)::

    python3.3 -m pip -U simplere

You may need to prefix these with ``sudo`` to authorize installation. In
environments without super-user privileges, you may want to use ``pip``'s
``--user`` option, to install only for a single user, rather than
system-wide. If you use the standalone ``pip`` programs, you may also
need to use ``pip2`` or ``pip3`` version-dependent variants, depending
on your system configuration.

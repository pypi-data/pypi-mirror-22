Description: # Jupyter Alabaster Theme
        
        [![Documentation Status](http://readthedocs.org/projects/jupyter-alabaster-theme/badge/?version=latest)](http://jupyter-alabaster-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
        
        A Sphinx theme for Jupyter based on the [Alabaster theme](https://alabaster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
        
        To use this theme on any Sphinx based documentation, follow these steps:
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install the `jupyter_alabaster_theme` package using pip:
        
        ```bash
        pip install jupyter_alabaster_theme
        ```
        
        ## Configuration
        
        To use the theme in your Sphinx based documentation, follow these steps. For further
        details, see the documentation for this theme [here](http://jupyter-alabaster-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
        
        ### Edit `conf.py`
        
        Most of the work to use the theme is in editing your `conf.py` file that configures
        Sphinx.
        
        First, You will need to set the theme itself to `jupyter_alabaster_theme`:
        
        ```python
        html_theme = 'jupyter_alabaster_theme'
        ```
        
        Second, you will need to add `jupyter_alabaster_theme` to the list of extensions:
        
        ```python
        extensions = [
            ...
            'jupyter_alabaster_theme',
        ]
        ```
        
        Finally, at the bottom of `conf.py`, the following block of code, if present, should be removed:
        
        ```python
        if not on_rtd:
            # only import and set the theme if we're building docs locally
            import sphinx_rtd_theme
            html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'
            html_theme_path = [sphinx_rtd_theme.get_html_theme_path()]
        ```
        
        ### Update documentation dependencies
        
        To get your documentation to build, you will need to update its build dependencies. Update your `environment.yml` or `requirements.txt` to depend on  `jupyter_alabaster_theme` to get the build working on ReadTheDocs. Note, we have not yet released a [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/intro.html) package for this theme, so you will need to list it in the `environment.yml` file under the `pip` section.

        ---------------------
        
        ``Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for
        machines to execute. ~ Hal Abelson``
        
        One quick way to become a better programmer is by reading code written by smart
        people. Github makes finding such code/repositories easy. At the end of the day
        we all are interested in our own specific areas and we express this interest by
        "starring" repositories and/or "following" people who contribute to such
        repositories.
        
        This is a tool which uses the repositories you have starred and the repositories
        that people you follow have starred to help you discover repositories which
        might be of interest to you.
        
        How fast is it?
        ---------------
        
        It totally depends on the number of repositories you have, and people you follow
        have starred. Based on this number it might take anywhere between a minute to
        two minutes to give you the list of suggested repositories.
        
        Setup
        -----
        
        Using pip
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install gitsuggest
        
        Directly from the repository
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            git clone https://github.com/csurfer/gitsuggest.git
            python gitsuggest/setup.py install
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        As a command
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            # For help with usage
            gitsuggest --help
        
            # With just username in command to provide password secretly
            gitsuggest <username>
        
            # NOTE: Using it this way generates a static html page with the search
            # results. This gets opened it in your default browser.
        
        As a module
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from gitsuggest import GitSuggest
        
            gs = GitSuggest(<username>, <password>)
        
            # To get an iterator over suggested repositories.
            gs.get_suggested_repositories()

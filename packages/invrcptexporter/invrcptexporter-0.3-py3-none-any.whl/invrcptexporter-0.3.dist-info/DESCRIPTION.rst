invrcptexporter
===============

a tool to export invoice and receipt from libreoffice calc into pdf file

virtualenv has to be created with option ``--system-site-packages`` as
it needs to use system site-packages which has uno module installed by
``$ sudo apt-get install python3-uno``, on Ubuntu. (Unfortunately, uno
module is not available from pip.)

The code is based on Christopher5106's tutorial (many thanks to him):

``('http://christopher5106.github.io/office/2015/12/06/openoffice-',    'libreoffice-automate-your-office-tasks-with-python-macros.html')``

How it works
------------

-  we open LibreOffice with socket open
-  we use Python to send commands to LibreOffice through the socket (you
   should use iptables to block incoming connection on the specified TCP
   port for security reason)

To open LibreOffice with socket open, use the command line below:

::

    libreoffice \
      --accept="socket,host=localhost,port=2002;urp;StarOffice.ServiceManager"

INSTALL for TESTING
-------------------

-  On Ubuntu 14.04

-  install python3-uno as a system-wide package as this package is not
   available via pip:

   ``$ sudo apt-get install python3-uno``

-  create virtualenv (probably, with virtualenvwrapper) with
   ``--system-site-pacakges``:

   ``$ mkvirtualenv --system-site-packages invrcptexporter``

-  install required packages from pip:

   ``$ pip install -r requirements-test.txt``

-  install poppler-utils from apt as we have to use pdftotext in our
   tests:

   ``$ sudo apt-get install poppler-utils``

   I have tried a few other alternatives such as extractText() from
   PyPDF2, it doesn't work for many cases

-  configure ``~/.invrcptexporterrc``:

   ``$ cd ~   $ cp /your/project/path/source/invrcptexporterrc .invrcptexporterrc``

   adjust settings in this rc file, the most important one is
   SCRIPT\_PATH which is the absolute path to 'source' directory

-  run the test:

   ``$ /your/project/path/source/test.sh``

   notes: test.sh is a hack (you can see details from comments inside
   test.sh ), each time you run it, you have to manually close (exit or
   ctrl+q) the opened libreoffice ui so that the test will continue to
   run

INSTALL for USER
----------------

TO\_BE\_CONTINUED - the program is currently shipped as a library only,
please see sample codes for how to use it from:

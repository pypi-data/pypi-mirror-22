QML: A Python Toolkit for Quantum Machine Learning
==================================================

QML is a Python2/3-compatible toolkit for representation learning of
properties of molecules and solids. QML is not a high-level framework
where you can do ``model.train()``, but supplies the building blocks to
carry out efficient and accurate machine learning on chemical compounds.
As such, the goal is to provide usable and efficient implementations of
concepts such as representations and kernels, which can then be
implemented in other machine learning codes.

1) Citing QML:
--------------

Until the preprint is available from arXiv, please cite this GitHub
repository as:

::

    AS Christensen, F Faber, B Huang, LA Bratholm, OA von Lilienfeld (2017) "QML: A Python Toolkit for Quantum Machine Learning" https://github.com/qmlcode/qml

2) Installation
---------------

Installing prerequisite modules (for most Linux systems):

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get install python-pip gfortran libblas-dev liblapack-dev git

These should already be installed on most systems. The Intel compilers
and MKL math-libraries are supported as well (see section 1.3).

2.1) Installing via ``pip``:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to install the stable version from the Python Package
Index (PyPI) is using the official, built-in Python package manager,
``pip``:

.. code:: bash

    pip install qml --user -U

Alternatively, you can install the most recent stable development
snapshot directly from GitHub:

.. code:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/qmlcode/qml --user -U

Use ``pip2 install ...`` or ``pip3 install ...`` to get the Python2 or
Python3 versions explicitly. QML supports both flavors.

To uninstall simply use ``pip`` again.

.. code:: bash

    pip uninstall qml

2.2) Installing via ``setup.py`` with Intel compiler:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have Intel compilers installed (2016 and newer), you can compile
QML with Ifort/MKL using the following options:

.. code:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/qmlcode/qml.git --user --upgrade --global-option="build" --global-option="--compiler=intelem" --global-option="--fcompiler=intelem"

2.3) Note on Apple/Mac support:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installing QML requires a Fortran compiler. On Darwin you can install it
using ``brew``:

.. code:: bash

    brew install gcc

Note the Clang Fortran compiler from brew unfortunately does not support
OpenMP. Therefore parallelism via OpenMP is disabled as default for
Darwin systems.

        # Getting Started
        
        ## Install VisiData
        
        ### from pypi (`stable` branch)
        
        ```
        $ pip3 install visidata
        ```
        
        ### or clone from git
        
        ```
        $ git clone http://github.com/saulpw/visidata.git
        $ cd visidata
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        $ python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ### Dependencies
        
        - Python 3.3+
        - h5py and numpy (if opening .hdf5 files)
        - google-api-python-client (if opening Google Sheets; must [also set up OAuth credentials](https://developers.google.com/sheets/quickstart/python )
        
        **Remember to install the Python3 versions of these packages with e.g. `pip3`**
        
        ## Run VisiData
        
        If installed via pip3, `vd` should launch without issue.
        
        ```
        $ vd [<options>] [<inputs> ...]
        ```
        
        If no inputs are given, `vd` opens the current directory.
        Unknown filetypes are by default viewed with a text browser.
        
        If installed via `git clone`, first set up some environment variables (on terminal):
        
        ```
        $ export PYTHONPATH=<visidata_dir>:$PYTHONPATH
        $ export PATH=<visidata_dir>/bin:$PATH
        ```

        VisiData needs lots of usage and testing to help it become useful and reliable.
        If you are actively using VisiData, please let me know!
        Maybe there is an easy way to improve the tool for both of us.
        
        Also please create a GitHub issue if anything doesn't appear to be working right.
        If you get an unexpected error, please include the full stack trace that you get with `^E`.

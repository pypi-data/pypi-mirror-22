        title:       Buildbot Builder Name
        description: |
            This Builder must exist on the Buildbot master that the Bridge
            is configured to work with. If not, a BuildRequest will be
            created for a non-existant Builder, and the Task will never run.

                    releases/mozilla-beta. Full URL can also be used, but it
                    will be shortened to repo path. Eg:
                    http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta becomes
                    mozilla-beta.

            # not provided by the Task, we shouldn't accept the job because it's
            # unlikely that we'll notice when its Build finishes. See bug 1195751
            # for additional background.

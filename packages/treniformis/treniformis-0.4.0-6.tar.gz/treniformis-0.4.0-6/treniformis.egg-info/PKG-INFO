        Example
        -------
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import treniformis
            treniformis.get_annual_list_path('GFW/WKV/FISHING/KNOWN/2016')
        
        
        Developing
        ----------
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/treniformis
            $ cd treniformis
            $ pip install -e .\[all\]
            $ py.test --cov treniformis --cov-report term-missing

        Likely Fishing
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Generated from a query of vessels identifying themselves as fishing in the
        ``shiptype_text`` field in the vessel identity messages in the type 5 and type
        24 AIS messages. Details of the query can be found in Benthos #397. In the next
        round we will filter out some additional "unknown" vessel types and probably
        drop the threshold to include some vessels that almost always identify
        themselves as fishing.
        
        Known Fishing
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Based on `public fishing registry records <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ICZzrkiaPPWV7sp0uytNnwXGRM8jTh6KjJ4026lDGU/edit?pref=2&pli=1#gid=1259036802>`_.
        
        Combined Fishing
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Produced by combining likely and known fishing lists and then removing sets of
        known non-fishing vessels (fish carriers, fishspotting helicopters, research
        vessels) along with short mmsi's (less than 5 digits)  and mmsi's that will
        likely have a large number of spoofing vessels (111111111). See Benthos #397.

"""Painless animated sprites which are pygame.sprite.Sprite objects.

Animated sprites are loaded from GIF, but there will be other ways
very soon! When using an AnimatedSprite you must remember to update
it every main loop iteration with timedelta:

  >>> AnimatedSprite.from_gif('example.gif')  # doctest: +SKIP
  >>> timedelta = clock.get_time()  # doctest: +SKIP
  >>> animated_sprite.update(timedelta)  # doctest: +SKIP

A word on `rect` and `mask`:
    `pygame.Sprite` has the `rect` attribute and _optionally_ the
    `mask` attribute. AnimatedSprite gets those attributes from
    its frames, however there are some important notes regarding
    these two properties, AnimatedSprite.rect (always there) and
    AnimatedSprite.mask (optional)...

    AnimatedSprite.rect.size is updated with the current frame's
    size every time you use AnimatedSprite.update(). This means you
    can use AnimatedSprite.rect for position on screen or position
    on map, whatever, because AnimatedSprite.rect.topleft won't change
    unless _you_ change it!

    Likewise, AnimatedSprite.mask is set to the current frame's mask,
    if you told AnimatedSprite to generate a mask (it's optional).
    There are plans in the near future to allow for a single custom
    mask or ways to provide custom frame masks.

    When you load an animated sprite, you can specify a threshold:

      >>> AnimatedSprite.from_gif('example.gif',
      ...                         mask_threshold=254)  # doctest: +SKIP

    Whereas, the threshold denotes the alpha transparency value for a
    pixel, which is opaque enough to be "set".

What's supported:
    Right now there's only support for GIFs, but I'd like to expand that
    (especially since GIFs can't really take advantage of alpha
    transparency).
